"""Extract cost-model features from the after-LX-planning LoopLevel IR.

Walks ``graph.operations`` and builds :class:`cost_model.OpFeatures` per op
(per-core cores, per-tensor-arg bytes + HBM/LX residency + broadcast flags),
then a dump hook (``SPYRE_DUMP_COST=1``) prints the features and the predicted
device latency so it can be compared against the measured value on hardware.

Extraction is best-effort and defensive: anything it can't resolve falls back to
a safe default and never raises into compilation. The numbers must be validated
against device measurements (``examples/bench_*``); the model is only as good as
this extraction.

    ``macs`` = the TOTAL multiply-accumulates the op performs across the WHOLE coarse
    loop, never a per-iteration slice. That distinction used to leak into the feature
    file: ``out_elems`` comes from the committed device layout and ``k_size`` from
    ``reduction_ranges``, and when the coarse loop tiles the REDUCTION dim each iteration
    sees only ``K/loop_trip``, so the raw product came out ``TOTAL/loop_trip``. When the
    loop tiles only an OUTPUT dim the output buffer is full-extent and the raw product is
    already the total. The consumer (cost_model.predict_ops) multiplies nothing by
    ``loop_trip``, so the reduction-tiled ops were under-counting compute by up to 16x.

    The scale is ``out_factor``: how many times the op's output buffer is produced over
    the whole loop nest, the write's own loop factor from ``extract_op_features``.  The
    raw product ``out_elems * K`` is one pass over the output buffer, so the work of the
    whole nest is that product times the number of passes:

    * output-tiled loop: the buffer is full-extent and walked once -> 1;
    * reduction-tiled loop: the write has no reduction variable, so the same output
      tile is produced every trip with ``K / trips`` each time -> ``trips``;
    * per-trip body op of a ``for_each_tile`` loop (one expert's MLP, one attention
      step over a KV page), re-writing the same buffer each trip -> ``trips``;
    * per-trip body op writing its own slice of a stacked buffer (``out[u0, m, n]``
      into ``[E, T, N]``): the buffer already holds every trip -> 1.  This is the
      write-index form the factor handles; whether a lowered body ``batchmatmul``
      reaches that write is not established (its test is synthetic);
    * nested loops: the product over levels (``mm_nested_m_k`` -> 4).

    The factor is per level, so a nest that tiles at one level and not another is
    priced at each level by what that level does.

    ``rows_per_core`` = M/m (drives pt_eff + A re-read),
    ``cols_per_core`` = N/n (drives B re-read). ``a_bytes`` = |A| = M*K, ``b_bytes`` =
    |B| = K*N (device dtype). ``k_split``/``m_split``/``n_split`` = the K/M/N core splits.
    M/N/K + splits are recovered from the iteration space: reduction (K) vars have coeff 0
    in the write index. Among the OUTPUT vars the batch is EXCLUDED -- a 3D [B,M,N] bmm
    output puts the batch at the LARGEST write-index coeff, so the old "largest coeff = M"
    mis-picked batch as M for B>=2 (rows_per_core came out as the batch size). M/N are taken
    from the named-dim map when present (work_div-hinted runs) else from the two smallest
