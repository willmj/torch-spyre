    Attributes
    ----------
    reduction_type:
        ``op.data.reduction_type`` (e.g. ``"sum"``, ``"max"``).
    identity:
        Monoid identity value for ``reduction_type``, from
        ``_reduction_identity_value``.
    is_nested:
        True when an outer level tiles an output dim and an inner level
        tiles a reduction dim, requiring separate tile-sized and full-sized
        accumulators (see ``_compute_fill_loop_info_planned``). False for a flat
        (reduction-dim-only) tiling.
    full_output_ranges:
        Full (pre-division) output shape for the accumulation buffer --
        planning runs before ``_apply_plan`` divides ``op.data.ranges``, so
        this is just ``op.data.ranges`` at planning time, unchanged.
    per_tile_ranges:
        Per-outer-tile output shape: ``op.data.ranges`` at planning time with
        every tiled dim divided by its ``loop_count`` (mirrors the division
        ``_divide_ranges`` performs later, in place, during transformation).
    outer_fill_loop_info:
        ``CoarseTileInfo`` covering only the outer output-dim levels, to
        stamp on the fill op for a nested tiling
        (``_compute_fill_loop_info_planned``).
        ``None`` for a flat tiling, where the fill runs once before all loops.
        Its ``loop_group_id`` is planning-time, pre-offset numbering --
        transformation must re-slice it from the op's own real, stamped
        ``loop_group_id`` before use (see ``_propagate_tiled_reduction_op``).
    full_output_strides:
        Host strides of the full-sized accumulation buffer, captured from
        ``op.layout.stride`` at planning time (before ``_divide_ranges`` runs).
    per_tile_strides:
        Host strides of the per-outer-tile accumulation buffer, derived from
        ``full_output_strides`` via ``compute_tile_stride`` at planning time.
    full_output_device_layout:
        Original (pre-division) device layout of the op's output, which the
        full-sized accumulation buffer takes as its own -- see
        ``PropagationPlan.full_device_layout``, the copy-out's counterpart.

    these decisions -- it never makes new ones.

    Attributes
    ----------
    kind:
        ``"loop_internal"``: the op's own buffer is scratch reused every
        iteration; its write must not advance at any level.
        ``"copy_out"``: the op's result is consumed outside its loop group
        (or is a graph output) and needs a full-sized buffer + copy op.
        ``"reduction"``: the op is a Reduction tiled over a reduction dim;
        see ``reduction`` for the accumulator/fill/combine shape decisions.
        ``"mutation_write_back"``: the op already carries
        ``MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE`` targeting a graph-output buffer; it
        IS the cross-tile write-back, so no separate copy op is inserted —
        only ``output_tiled_dims`` is set so the hardware advances its write
        pointer per tile.
    full_ranges:
        Full (pre-division) iteration ranges for the copy-out's full buffer.
        Only set when ``kind == "copy_out"``.
    full_strides:
        Original (pre-division) strides of the tiled op's layout, captured at
        planning time before ``_divide_ranges`` mutates the op.  Only set when
        ``kind == "copy_out"``.
    full_device_layout:
        Original (pre-division) device layout of the tiled op's output, which
        the copy-out's full buffer takes as its own.  Captured at planning time
        because it cannot always be recovered from the tile: once two host
        dims of the tile have extent 1, their device dims are
        indistinguishable.  ``None`` when the op has no device layout yet
        (pre-stickify) or when the full buffer is larger than the op's own
        output (a WhileLoop-splice dim).
    reduction:
        Shape/identity/nesting decisions for the reduction machinery. Only
        set when ``kind == "reduction"``.
    outside_consumer_names:
        Names (not object references -- see ``_find_outside_consumers``, and
        the module docstring on name stability) of ComputedBuffers outside
        this op's own outermost loop group that read this op's result.
    is_graph_output:
        True if this op's buffer name appears in the graph's output names,
        OR if this op is a ``MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE`` write into a
        locally-created buffer that itself is the graph output (see
        ``graph_output_name``).
    graph_output_name:
        Only set (and only differs from the op's own name) when this op is
        a ``MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE`` write whose mutation *target* --
        not the op's own buffer -- is the graph output (e.g.
        ``copy_forced(src, c)`` where ``c`` is a locally-created buffer that is
        also the function's return value). ``None`` otherwise, meaning the
        op's own name should be used to patch ``V.graph.graph_outputs``.
    consumer_lookup_name:
        Only set (and only differs from the op's own name) when this op is
        a ``MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE`` write whose mutation *target* --
        not the op's own buffer -- is what outside ops actually read (e.g.
        ``copy_forced(src, c)`` where ``c`` is a locally-created buffer read
        later by another op). Transform-time consumer re-resolution
        (``_propagate_tiled_op``) and the read-redirect it performs
        (``_patch_consumers``) must search for reads of this name instead of
        the op's own name. ``None`` otherwise, meaning the op's own name

    Attributes

    loop_group_id:
        Tuple encoding the nesting path, e.g. ``(0,)`` for an outermost
        group, ``(0, 0)`` for a nested group inside group 0.
    loop_count:
        List of trip counts, one per nesting level from outermost to
        innermost.  ``len(loop_count) == len(loop_group_id)`` always holds.
    loop_tiled_dims:
        List of lists, one sub-list per nesting level.  Each sub-list
        contains the ``data.ranges`` positional indices that are tiled at
        that level.  An empty sub-list means the op is loop-invariant at
        that level.
    loop_tiled_reduction_dims:
        List of lists, one sub-list per nesting level.  Each sub-list
        contains the ``data.reduction_ranges`` positional indices that are
        tiled at that level.  An empty sub-list means no reduction dim is
        tiled at that level.  Parallel to ``loop_tiled_dims``.
    tiled_dims_per_read:
        One entry per read dependency in ``op.get_read_writes().reads`` (in
        that iteration order, filtered to ``MemoryDep`` -- same positional
        convention the deleted ``tile_advance_exprs`` used). Each entry is a
        list of per-nesting-level ``(op_dim_index, extent)`` pairs,
        outermost level first (matching ``loop_count``/``loop_tiled_dims``):
        the host-range positional dims (or ``n_output_dims + reduction_pos``
        for reduction dims, matching ``loop_tiled_dims``'s own numbering)
        tiled *for this dependency* at that level, paired with that level's
        own tile extent: for a dim tiled at more than one level, an outer
        level's extent equals the final (innermost) extent times the
        product of every more-inner level's own count that also tiles that
        dim.
        An empty per-level list means this read's address does not advance at
        that level. It does not by itself prove value invariance: a producer
        may rewrite fixed-address scratch on every trip. This is a tiling
        *decision*, not a substituted index expression -- deferred
        substitution into the dependency's actual
        (possibly later-rewritten) index expression happens in
        spyre_kernel.py at OpSpec/TensorArg construction time, when the
        index is guaranteed final.
    output_tiled_dims:
        The analogous per-level ``(op_dim_index, extent)`` list for this
        op's own write dependency. Defaults to ``[]`` (no levels tiled).
    squeezed_advance_per_read:
        One entry per read dependency, parallel to ``tiled_dims_per_read``.
        Each entry is a list of per-nesting-level ``(host_stride, extent)``
        pairs for dims tiled down to extent 1 in this dep's own iteration
        space -- Inductor's ``SqueezeView.squeezer`` unconditionally drops
        any such dim from ``dep.index`` (called via
        ``ComputedBuffer.get_read_writes()`` -> ``extract_read_writes`` ->
        ``index_vars_squeeze``), so no ``d{i}`` symbol survives for
        ``_host_dim_to_index_symbol`` to substitute into -- unlike a dim
        merely absent from one read among several (genuine broadcast),
        which ``tiled_dims_per_read`` already handles correctly via
        substitution. ``host_stride`` is the dim's canonical index
        coefficient in the *squeezed* iteration space of the op whose
        ``data.ranges`` sizes this dim (product of that op's own
        ``data.ranges`` sizes strictly to the dim's right) -- the same units
        every surviving ``d{i}`` symbol in ``dep.index`` already carries,
        since Inductor mints those coefficients over the unsqueezed
        ``data.ranges`` and squeeze only renumbers/drops symbols, never
        rescales them. This is deliberately NOT the buffer's real PyTorch
        memory stride (``full_buf.layout.stride``) -- that is a different
        unit system that ``tiling_expr_to_device_expr``'s ``stride_map``-
        based dimension selection cannot be compared against, and picking
        the wrong device axis when the two happen to diverge silently
        advances the wrong dimension (see issue surfaced by
        ``test_flash_tile_B``). Independent of ``dep.index`` entirely, so
        ``SpyreKernel._general_tile_advance`` can add its device-address
        contribution as an extra term via ``tiling_expr_to_device_expr``
        rather than by substitution. An empty per-read list means that read
        has no such dims. The outer list may also be empty when no read in the
        operation needs squeezed-dimension metadata; that is complete "none
        needed" metadata, not a missing entry for every read.
    squeezed_advance_output:
        The analogous per-level ``(host_stride, extent)`` list for this op's
        own write dependency, parallel to ``output_tiled_dims`` the same way
        ``squeezed_advance_per_read`` is parallel to ``tiled_dims_per_read``.
        Defaults to ``[]`` (no levels tiled).
    propagation:
        Planned decision for how this op's result crosses its loop
        boundary, computed by ``_plan_tiling_propagation``. ``None`` until
        that planning stage runs (or for ops it doesn't cover).
