"""Structured timing records for the compiler frontend.

The INFO-level ``elapsed <ms> <pass>`` line in passes.py is readable but not
comparable: it carries no graph sizes, no run metadata, and only covers one of
the six pass pipelines. This records the same regions as JSON instead, so a
baseline taken today can be compared against one taken after a change.

Off unless ``config.timing``. Enable it with ``TORCH_SPYRE_TIMING=1`` and point
``TORCH_SPYRE_TIMING_OUT`` at a path to get a record::

    {"meta": {...},
     "events": [{"name": "pass:CustomPreSchedulingPasses:span_reduction",
                 "ordinal": 4, "parent_ordinal": 1,
                 "t_start_ns": ..., "t_end_ns": ...,
                 "inclusive_ns": ..., "self_ns": ...,
                 "meta": {"input_operations": 260, "output_operations": 260}},
                ...]}

``meta`` and ``error`` appear only when non-empty; ``open`` appears only on a
region still running when the record was written.

Event names have three shapes, so a reader can group without a lookup table:
``pipeline:<PipelineClass>``, ``pass:<PipelineClass>:<pass_name>``, and
``stage:<Owner>:<what>`` for a region that is not a pass -- work a pipeline does
around its pass list, or a stage of the compile outside the pipelines entirely.
Owner ``torch`` means an upstream ``dynamo_timed`` phase mirrored into the record
by torch_phases.py, which is how lowering, codegen and tracing are accounted for;
read its module docstring before relying on one of those names.

Frontend time for one compile is a subtraction, not a span, because the backend
runs per kernel from inside codegen::

    pre_backend = stage:compile_fx:spyre_compile.inclusive_ns
                  - sum(stage:SpyreAsyncCompile:backend_compile.inclusive_ns
                        under that compile)

One event name covers every backend invocation, whichever route reached it, with
the compiler named in its ``meta["tool"]``, so the subtraction does not go stale
when an emitter is added.

A process compiling several graphs has one such event per compile, so group by
the enclosing ``stage:compile_fx:spyre_compile`` rather than summing the record.
That region is the compile, not the root: the mirrored Dynamo phases enclose it,
so a reader must find it by name rather than by having no parent.

Events nest, so ``inclusive_ns`` double-counts across levels and ``self_ns``
does not. Ordinals are assignment-ordered, which reproduces the wall-clock
timeline of one process even when compiles interleave across threads.

One record is written per process: the configured path gets the pid inserted
before its suffix (``rec.json`` -> ``rec.<pid>.json``), because a compile can
fan out into subprocesses and worker processes that inherit the environment,
and a single shared filename would leave one arbitrary winner.

``RECORDER_VERSION`` identifies the shape of the record above. Bump it when an
existing field changes meaning, is renamed, or is removed -- anything that
would make an older record misread by a reader written against the new shape.
Adding a new event name or a new ``meta`` key does not need a bump; readers
must tolerate unknown names and keys.
