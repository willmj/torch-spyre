"""Generic, for_each_tile-independent bridge from a WhileLoop op to a
coarse-tile-shaped group of spliced ir.Operations.

Deliberately knows nothing about for_each_tile's own frontend contract
(Kind.SLICE/GATHER/INVARIANT, TileSpec, etc.) -- that classification lives in
wsr/for_each_tile_lowering.py, which is this module's only caller. Anything
here should stay reusable by a future, differently-shaped while_loop
producer.

Overall algorithm: ``splice_while_loop`` replaces a WhileLoop op with its
body subgraph's own ops spliced directly into the outer graph -- the loop
structure itself is discarded, with iteration folded into DimHints/levels by
the caller (wsr/for_each_tile_lowering.py). Splicing this single body copy
in once means every carry (one per position in ``while_op.carried_inputs``,
see ``CarryBinding``) needs its reads and writes rewired so this one copy
behaves like every trip at once. Three carry shapes exist, each rewired
differently:

  pass-through  the body never rewrites this carry (body_output IS the
                placeholder object). Its read is aliased straight to the
                real ``while_op.carried_inputs[i]`` object; nothing else is
                needed.
  accumulator   the body computes a new value each iteration, in place,
                read once at the end. Rewired via fill/rewrite/drain:

                  fill    the carry's own real initial buffer's pre-loop
                          producer seeds it
                  rewrite the single spliced copy of the body op that wrote
                          this carry is redirected (via
                          ``_rewire_accumulator_output``) to read and write
                          that same real initial buffer in place, standing
                          in for every trip
                  drain   the buffer itself IS the final value after the
                          last trip, so outside consumers read it directly

  stacking      each iteration writes a DIFFERENT SLICE of one larger
                result (e.g. ``scan``'s ``ys``). There is no intermediate
                per-iteration state to thread, so no scratch buffer is
                needed at all -- instead the destination buffer's own
                layout is folded from ``[trip_count, *tile]`` to the flat
                result shape via ``fold_stacked_carry_layout``, and the
                per-iteration write becomes an ordinary tile-advancing
                write into it.

See ``CarryBinding``'s own docstring for the accumulator/stacking split in
more detail, and ``splice_while_loop``'s docstring for how reads (two
distinct shapes: name-based ``ops.load`` calls vs. direct object references
held in ``.inputs``) and writes are actually redirected.

    ----------
    carry_index:
        Position in ``while_op.carried_inputs`` / the body subgraph's
        ``graph_outputs`` -- carries are matched purely positionally on the
        raw IR (see ``ir.py``'s ``WhileLoop.create``, which asserts
        ``len(carried_inputs) == len(body_outputs)``).
    initial:
        ``while_op.carried_inputs[carry_index]`` -- the pre-loop value that
        seeds the carry's scratch buffer (the "fill" step).
    body_output:
        ``while_op.body_subgraph.graph.graph_outputs[carry_index]`` -- the
        body's own per-iteration result for this carry position (what the
        "rewrite" step redirects the body's write to, and what "drain"
        reads after the last iteration).
    scratch_name:
        Persistent buffer identity threaded through every iteration.
    stacking:
        Whether this carry is a STACKING carry rather than an ACCUMULATOR.
        The raw IR models the two identically -- both are just a position in
        ``carried_inputs``/``body_outputs`` -- but they need opposite
        treatment, and only the caller (which understands the producing
        frontend's contract) can tell them apart:

        - **Accumulator** (``stacking=False``, the default): the same
          logical value, same shape, updated in place every iteration and
          read once at the end. This is the pattern the existing
          fill/rewrite/drain ``scratch_name`` redirect is built for, and it
          is left completely untouched by the stacking machinery below.
        - **Stacking** (``stacking=True``): each iteration writes a
          DIFFERENT SLICE of one larger result -- ``scan``'s ``ys``
          accumulation, which upstream materializes as a
          ``[trip_count, *tile]`` buffer that the caller then folds back to
          ``[trip_count * tile[0], *tile[1:]]``. There is no intermediate
          per-iteration state to thread, so it needs no scratch buffer at
          all; what it needs instead is for its own destination buffer's
          layout to BE the folded shape, so the per-iteration write is an
          ordinary tile-advancing write into it. See

    Upstream's ``scan`` lowering allocates a stacking carry (see
    ``CarryBinding.stacking``) as a genuinely rank-(n+1)
    ``[trip_count, *tile]`` "stack of tiles" buffer, and returns the real
    result as a ``ReinterpretView`` of it with the leading two axes merged --
    a pure view, since merging two contiguous leading axes is expressible in
    strides.

    This bridge's splice discards the loop structure and folds iteration
    into DimHints, so the per-iteration write becomes an ordinary
    tile-advancing write into one flat destination. That destination's own
    layout must therefore be the FOLDED shape: leaving the rank-(n+1)
    stacked layout in place is what produced the
    ``AssertionError: size=[8, 6], stride=[12, 6, 1]`` in
    ``coarse_tile.py``'s ``_allocate_full_buffer`` -- the write's planned
    full ranges are 2-D while the buffer it targets is still 3-D.

    Rewrites ``node``'s layout in place to
    ``[trip_count * tile[0], *tile[1:]]`` with the corresponding contiguous
    strides, and drops the matching leading axis from its ``data.ranges``
    when it has one. The two are the same storage with the same element
    order, so nothing about what the buffer holds changes -- only how many
    axes name it.

    Mutating in place (rather than substituting a fresh buffer object
    everywhere, as ``_substitute_direct_input_refs`` must do for a
    placeholder) is safe because a ``Layout`` object belongs to exactly one
    buffer: verified for this shape that the carry buffer, the body's own
    placeholder, and the graph output's ``ReinterpretView`` each hold a
    distinct ``FixedLayout`` instance. The graph output's view is unaffected
    -- it already describes the folded shape, so after this it is an exact
    identity view of the buffer instead of a reshape of it.

    Returns True if a fold was applied, False if the layout was not a
    foldable stacked shape (already folded, non-contiguous leading axes, or
    a symbolic trip count that does not match the leading extent). Declining
    is not an error: a caller that mis-classifies a carry as stacking simply

    Ops without an `inner_fn` (DynamicScalar, ExternKernelOut, ...) hold
    their reads as direct Python object references in `.inputs`, not as
    named index-expression loads: DynamicScalar.inputs[0] is always the
    body's own iteration-carry placeholder object, and ExternKernelOut's
    per-tile operand input is either the placeholder object itself or a
    frozen ReinterpretView/mutable StorageBox wrapping it. Renaming a dict
    entry (as redirect_computed_buffer_reads does for inner_fn loads) does
    nothing for these -- the object reference itself must be replaced.

    A third read shape exists alongside the two documented above: a
    ComputedBuffer with a MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE layout holds its
    mutation target as a direct object reference on `op.layout.target`
    (set once in Layout.__init__ and never renamed) -- not in `.inputs`,
    not a named ops.load. E.g. a body-internal constant_pad_nd/copy pair
    can target the body's own per-tile-invariant operand placeholder (a
    map-mode carry), which after splicing is never registered in the outer
    graph's buffer namespace -- V.graph.get_buffer(target_name) in
    propagate_layouts.py's mutation-op handling then raises "Failed to find
    buffer matching name ...". Patch op.layout.target in place the same way
    as an `.inputs` entry (one level of StorageBox unwrapping included) so
    it resolves to the real outer-graph object splice_while_loop already
    computed, exactly as `.inputs` entries do.

    ref_map maps a placeholder buffer's own name to the real object it
    should resolve to (a carry's scratch buffer, or the real outer-graph
    value for a non-carry per-tile operand). Mutates each op's `.inputs`
    list in place (`ExternKernel.inputs` is an ordinary mutable list) and,
    for the one observed wrapped case (StorageBox, itself mutable) rewrites
    the wrapper's `.data` in place rather than fighting ReinterpretView's
    frozen dataclass -- ReinterpretView.data is looked up dynamically by
    every consumer, so the wrapped StorageBox's identity does not need to
    change, only what it points at.

    A fourth read shape exists for a NESTED for_each_tile: a nested
    `ir.WhileLoop` op (the inner loop, still an ordinary entry of `body_ops`
    until it is itself spliced on a later fixed-point pass) holds its own
    reads as direct object references on `.carried_inputs`/
    `.additional_inputs` -- separate list attributes from `.inputs`
    (`WhileLoop.__init__` assigns `self.carried_inputs = carried_inputs`
    directly, while `.inputs` is a distinct, repacked tensor-only list built
    by `ExternKernel.__init__` via `_split_by_sym_type`). Patching `.inputs`
    alone leaves `.carried_inputs`/`.additional_inputs` pointing at this
    (outer) body's own placeholder objects, which are never registered in
    the outer graph's buffer namespace once this splice completes -- so
    `carry_bindings_for`/`splice_while_loop`, run against the inner loop on
    the next fixed-point pass, would resolve a stale placeholder name and
    crash downstream (`Failed to find buffer matching name ...`), same as
    the `.inputs`/`.layout.target` shapes above. Patch both lists in place,
    same substitution rule as `.inputs`.

    Whole-object substitution (rebinding a list slot or `.layout.target`
    directly to the resolved replacement) is only correct when the node
    being replaced is a bare identity wrapper for the placeholder -- i.e. it
    contributes no reslicing/offset/layout information of its own beyond
    forwarding to the placeholder. `ReinterpretView` is NOT such a wrapper:
    `ReinterpretView.get_name()` delegates to `self.data.get_name()` (see
    ir.py), so `resolve()` happily resolves a `ReinterpretView` by the name
    of the placeholder it wraps -- but the `ReinterpretView` itself carries
    its own real `FixedLayout`/offset describing a *slice* of that
    placeholder (e.g. one per-iteration tile of an invariant operand).
    Substituting the whole `ReinterpretView` object away, as a naive
    `resolve(node) is not None` check would do, silently discards that
    slice/offset and hands consumers the placeholder's raw, untiled layout
    instead: a MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE target's real_layout() would then
    deliver the untiled buffer's layout while the mutation op's own store
    still computes indices against the tile's own small iteration domain --
    a well-formed but wrong-slice layout, which surfaces downstream as a
    stride/size mismatch wherever a consumer's `_fixed_indexer` was closed
    over the tile's own FixedLayout but the unwrap chain now bottoms out at
    the InputBuffer's untiled one instead. So: only replace whole-node when
    the node has no distinguishing layout of its own (a bare
    StorageBox/InputBuffer/TensorBox pass-through);
    for a ReinterpretView (or any node whose own `.data` is a StorageBox
    still pointing at the placeholder), unwrap one level and patch the
    inner StorageBox's `.data` in place instead, leaving the ReinterpretView
    node itself (and its own layout/offset) completely untouched.

    """Return every spliced op that executes AFTER body_output_name's own
    producer and still reads placeholder_name (the carry's OLD,
    pre-iteration value).

    ``_rewire_accumulator_output`` makes the carry's new value land in place
    in the carry's own initial buffer -- correct for PyTorch's ``while_loop``
    semantics (which give every iteration's body a copy-in/compute/copy-out
    view of each carry) only because the *read* side is also redirected to
    that same buffer (see splice_while_loop's ``name_map``). Once the
    producer's write has landed there, any OTHER op that still reads
    placeholder_name is asking for the OLD value but will actually observe
    the NEW one -- a write-after-read hazard invisible to ``split_k_fn``
    (whose ``acc + x @ y`` reads the carry exactly once, in the producer
    itself) but real for a body like online-softmax's ``correction =
    exp(m - m_new)``, which legitimately needs both m's old value and its
    freshly-computed new value in the same pass.

    The exemption is by EXECUTION ORDER, not by identity with the producer
    op alone: a multi-op producer chain (e.g. online-softmax's `l_new = l *
    correction + p.sum(...)`, where `buf12 = l * correction` reads l's
    placeholder and only the later `buf14 = buf12 + buf13` is
    body_output_name/the op _rewire_accumulator_output aliases in place)
    has earlier steps that read the placeholder before the in-place write
    has happened -- those reads are safe regardless of whether they are
    body_output_name's own op. Only ops that appear AFTER body_output_name
    in body_ops's topological order and still read placeholder_name are
    real hazards.

    Uses op.get_read_writes() rather than hand-parsing inner_fn/.inputs, so
    both read shapes (named ops.load calls and DynamicScalar/
    ExternKernelOut's direct object-reference inputs) surface uniformly
    regardless of op kind.

    get_read_writes() is not guaranteed to succeed for every Operation
    subclass that can appear in a spliced while-loop body -- e.g.
    ComputedBuffer's implementation traces inner_fn symbolically via
    extract_read_writes(), which can raise for reasons that are hard to
    enumerate exhaustively (unhandled ops, symbolic-shape edge cases). A
    failure here means this function cannot determine whether op reads
    placeholder_name, so treating it as "no read" would risk silently
    missing a real write-after-read hazard. Raise instead of guessing.

    Turns the body op that produces ``binding.body_output`` into an in-place

    swapping its layout for ``MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE(real_input)``, and
    repoints any outside consumer of the loop's result for this carry
    position at that same buffer.

    Why the initial buffer and not a fresh one: the accumulator's fill is
    already there. ``for_each_tile(..., init=torch.zeros(M, N))`` lowers to a
    real zeros-filling ``ComputedBuffer`` that runs before the loop, which is
    exactly the "fill" step WSR's ``CarriedReductionRecord`` pattern wants;
    reusing it avoids synthesizing a second fill (and a second buffer) that
    would then have to be kept consistent with it.

    The outside consumer is reached through the ``WhileLoop``'s
    ``MultiOutput`` child for this carry index -- the object
    ``graph.graph_outputs`` (or any downstream op) actually holds, since the
    ``WhileLoop`` itself has a ``MultiOutputLayout`` and is never read
    directly. ``splice_while_loop`` drops those children right after this
    runs, so anything still pointing at one would dangle: a
    ``graph_outputs`` entry naming a removed buffer produces a wrapper with
    an empty body and a ``NameError`` at runtime.

    """Replace while_op in graph.operations with its body subgraph's ops.

    A carry the caller marked ``stacking=True`` (see ``CarryBinding``) is
    handled entirely differently from the accumulator path described below:
    its destination buffer's layout is folded from ``[trip_count, *tile]``
    to the flat result shape via ``fold_stacked_carry_layout`` (which needs
    ``trip_count``; passing None disables the fold), and NO ``scratch_name``
    redirect is applied to it. There is no intermediate per-iteration state
    to thread for a stacking carry -- each iteration writes a different
    slice of the final buffer and nothing reads a previous iteration's
    slice back -- so the write stays pointed at the real buffer and becomes
    an ordinary tile-advancing write, driven by the DimHints the caller
    stamps. That also leaves the outside consumer of the loop's result
    (a ``ReinterpretView`` of the same buffer, already describing the folded
    shape) correct with no patching.

    Carry rewiring (fill/rewrite/drain) for an ACCUMULATOR carry: the body
    op that writes this carry's per-iteration value is redirected in place,
    via ``_rewire_accumulator_output``, to write the carry's own real
    initial buffer instead of the body subgraph's placeholder --

      fill    the initial buffer's own pre-loop producer (e.g. a zeros fill
              for split_k_fn's ``torch.zeros(M, N)`` init)
      rewrite this single spliced copy of the op reads the buffer and
              writes it back in place, standing in for every trip
      drain   the buffer itself IS the final value after the last trip, so
              outside consumers read it directly

    (see ``_rewire_accumulator_output``'s own comment for the full
    rationale, including why this replaced an earlier ``scratch_name``
    redirect that no buffer was ever materialized under).

    So the read side is handled per carry shape, distinguishing two cases by
    identity:

    - Pass-through carry: body_output IS the placeholder object itself
      (the body never rewrites this carry -- e.g. a per-tile xs leaf
      threaded through unmodified). Its read is aliased straight to the
      real while_op.carried_inputs[i] object, already live in the outer
      graph -- correct and available today, no scratch buffer needed.
    - Mutated carry: body_output is a different, real op-produced buffer
      (the body computes a new value each iteration -- e.g. an
      accumulator). Splicing the body in once (as this bridge does; the
      loop structure itself is discarded, with iteration folded into
      DimHints/levels by the caller) means this single copy of the body
      reads the carry's pre-loop initial value, exactly as the first real
      iteration would -- so its read is aliased to
      while_op.carried_inputs[i] too, same as the pass-through case. Only
      the *write* side (body_output) is redirected -- not to scratch_name,
      but to the carry's own real initial buffer, via
      _rewire_accumulator_output, per the fill/rewrite/drain mechanism
      described above.

    Two distinct read shapes exist in the body and both need rewiring:
    ComputedBuffer.inner_fn issues ops.load(name, index) calls (name-based
    -- handled by redirect_computed_buffer_reads/NameSwapHandler, per
    CLAUDE.md's "wrap, never reconstruct" rule); DynamicScalar/
    ExternKernelOut hold direct Python object references to the
    placeholder buffer in `.inputs` (object-based -- handled by
    _substitute_direct_input_refs, since no name_map rename can reach a
    held object reference). A mutated-carry placeholder is read exclusively
    via inner_fn/ops.load; direct .inputs references only ever target
    pass-through carries, and a single carry can be read by both shapes at
    once (e.g. a counter carry read both by an inner_fn load and by a
    DynamicScalar's direct input) -- so both maps are populated for every
    carry regardless of shape, rather than assuming shape predicts read
    kind.

    Returns the spliced body ops (graph.operations, still in topological
    order) so the caller can build a coarse-tile (ops, levels) group from
    them.
