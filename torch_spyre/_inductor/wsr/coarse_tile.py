"""Coarse-tiling IR pass: stamp loop_group_id / loop_count on ir.Operation objects.

Each group of operations is wrapped in one or more nested counted loops.  For
every operation in the group the iteration ranges divided by each loop's trip
count are scaled down by that factor; the resulting (smaller) per-iteration
ranges are what the downstream scheduler and work-division passes will see.

A ``loop_group_id`` tuple encodes the nesting path:
  - ``(g,)``       — outermost loop group with index ``g``
  - ``(g, h)``     — inner loop group ``h`` nested inside outer group ``g``
  - etc.

``loop_count`` is a *list* of trip counts, one per nesting level from outermost
to innermost.  For a single-level group this is a 1-element list ``[K]``.
``loop_tiled_dims`` is a *list of lists*, one sub-list per nesting level.

Entry point::

    groups = hints_to_coarse_tile_groups(graph)
    coarse_tile_pre_stickify(graph, groups)

``groups`` is a list of ``(ops, levels)`` tuples where ``levels`` is a list of
``(hint_id, count)`` pairs, outermost first.  Each op resolves its own
tiled dimension from its ``loop_var`` in ``dim_hints``.

Each ``ops`` list must be a contiguous sub-sequence of ``operations``.

After stamping, each entry point runs its own sequence of passes.
``coarse_tile_pre_stickify`` runs ``_insert_all_read_copy_ops``,
``_insert_all_reduction_ops``, then ``_insert_all_write_copy_ops``;
``coarse_tile_post_stickify`` skips ``_insert_all_read_copy_ops`` and runs
only the latter two. All three passes allocate full-sized output buffers
and insert copy/mutation/reduction ops for tiled operations whose results
are consumed outside the loop, driven by the ``PropagationPlan`` each op's
``loop_info`` already carries from planning.

Before touching any ``inner_fn``/``layout``/``MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE``
rewiring in this file, read "Appendix: How IR rewiring works, and why it's
sound" in ``docs/source/compiler/coarse_tiling_loops.md``. It documents the
wrap-never-reconstruct convention and why ``MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE``
sites must satisfy the single-mutation-target invariant -- the same ground
this file's rewrite sites depend on.

    kind at all for a tiled op: "loop_internal" (nothing advances it),
    "copy_out" (the Pass 3 copy op drains it), or "reduction" (the Pass 2
    combine op drains it, and _propagate_tiled_reduction_op zeroes it
    unconditionally). The reduction case matters here even though the
    accumulator buffer itself is never read by name: a tiled-reduction op's
    *own* buffer (e.g. an amax result feeding a same-loop subtraction, as in
    softmax) IS commonly read by name by a sibling op in the same group, and
    that sibling's tiled_dims_per_read entry for it must be zeroed exactly
    like the loop_internal/copy_out cases. Unlike the deleted
    transformation-time pass, every op's kind is already known for the
    whole plan at this point (computed above, before any mutation), so
    there is no reader-before-producer ordering hazard to work around --
    this always sees the complete, final fixed set on its one and only
    pass.

    "mutation_write_back" is deliberately excluded: that kind means the
    op's own write genuinely advances per iteration (its target -- e.g. a
    flash-attention running max/denominator carry -- is read back by name
    on a later iteration, see the in_loop_carry check above), just via the
    squeezed_advance_output side channel rather than output_tiled_dims
    when the advancing dim divides to per-tile extent 1. Treating such an
    op as "fixed" here would zero its own output_tiled_dims (when that
    happens to be nonempty pre-squeeze) and any sibling's
    tiled_dims_per_read of it, erasing the only signal
    _propagate_mutation_write_back and the scratchpad allocator have for
    routing it away from LX -- see issue #4126.

    performs today for any free symbol absent from tiled_dim_extents.

    per_level_extents' keys are RAW positional indices into ir_node's own

    convention every loop_tiled_dims/output_tiled_dims producer in this file

    numbers, not raw positions. Comparing a raw key directly against a
    squeezed symbol number silently mismatches whenever a lower-numbered
    dim was squeezed out ahead of it (issue #3613). Translate each raw key
    through ir_node's own raw->squeezed table before the membership test;
    the returned tuples keep the ORIGINAL raw key, since that -- not the
    squeezed number -- is what every caller stores and what
    _host_dim_to_index_symbol re-squeezes for itself later.

    A raw dim tiled by a synthesized WhileLoop-splice DimHint (Task 5's
    _synthesize_dim_hints_for_group) has no d<N> symbol at all: its real
    per-iteration symbol is the spliced body's own unbacked loop_var (e.g.
    u0), folded directly into dep.index by construction -- it is never
    renamed into the d<N> squeezed namespace, so the d-prefix membership
    test below can never see it. Resolve such a dim's real symbol via
    ir_node.dim_hints (the same hint_id->position mapping
    plan_coarse_tile_groups already uses to build per_level_extents in the
    first place -- see _loop_var_to_ranges_pos/
    _loop_var_to_reduction_ranges_pos) and test dep.index's coefficient on
    that symbol directly, instead of name-matching.

    A dim's loop_var symbol only appears in the ONE dependency the splice
    machinery rewrote in place (the in-place carry target's own
    ReinterpretView offset, e.g. `_rebase_splice_write_offset`'s
    `12*u5`-style term) -- an op's other reads of that same tiled dim keep
    the ordinary squeezed d<N> convention and never contain the loop_var
    at all. So a zero coefficient on the loop_var does not mean this dep
    doesn't read dim d; it means this dep uses the other convention. Fall
    through to the d-prefix membership test rather than returning False --
    otherwise a real, ordinary-indexed read of a splice-tiled dim (e.g.
    the mutation_write_back write-back's OWN read of its non-carry input)
    is wrongly reported as not reading that dim at all, leaving it with no

    """Per-level advance terms for a POINT read that moves with the spliced loop.

    ``_tiled_dims_for_dep`` can only express a per-trip advance by naming a
    tiled dim of the reading op, and ``_loop_var_pos_from_reads`` can only
    find one when some read's own iteration var advances by a whole extent
    per trip. A read of a single element has no iteration var at all, so
    neither can represent it -- yet its address does advance. Paged
    attention's in-body page gather is exactly this shape: the body reads
    one page index out of the block table (``dep.index == 32*u0``,
    ``dep.size == ()``) and feeds it to an ``index_select`` over the KV
    pool, so ``u0`` occurs nowhere else in the whole body -- not in the
    gather's own pool read (indirect, ``64*d0 + d1 + 2048*tmp0``), not in
    its tile-local write. Left unrepresented, every trip re-reads the
    table's first element and gathers the same page (the wrong-answer
    outcome ``_read_copy_hoist_decision``'s ``UNRESOLVED_SPLICE_ADVANCE``
    exists to refuse rather than emit).

    A point read needs no dim to advance against: the whole read is one
    element, so the advance is unconditionally ``dep.index.coeff(loop_var)``
    host elements per trip of that level, with no interaction with any dim
    of the read. That is precisely the shape ``squeezed_advance_per_read``
    carries -- an independent ``level_symbol * extent * host_stride`` term
    that ``SpyreKernel._general_tile_advance`` projects through
    ``tiling_expr_to_device_expr`` instead of substituting into
    ``dep.index`` -- so it goes out through that same side channel rather
    than a third mechanism. ``extent`` is 1 because the loop var itself
    steps by 1 per trip and ``host_stride`` already carries the whole
    per-trip element stride. Both units match: ``coeff`` is a coefficient in
    ``dep.index``, the same host-element space every surviving ``d{i}``
    coefficient there uses, which is what that field documents.

    Deliberately restricted to reads with no iteration vars. A read that has
    dims but whose loop var still could not be attributed is a different,
    unproven case -- the advance may interact with the read's own window --
    and stays refused by ``_read_copy_hoist_decision``.

    ``unattributed_loop_vars`` maps hint_id to loop_var for exactly those
    WhileLoop-splice hints ``_hint_ranges_pos`` could not resolve on the
    reading op; a level whose hint *was* resolved is already represented in
    ``tiled_dims_per_read`` and must not be counted twice here.

    None``, see propagate_hints.py's DimHint docstring) is excluded even
    when some Reduction op tiles a reduction dim there. Both of this
    function's callers exist to catch a same-outer-group Pointwise sibling
    that would see a still-partial sum -- a real hazard for an ordinary
    spyre_hint() reduction group, where nothing else re-runs the Pointwise
    op once the reduction's own inner loop finishes accumulating. A
    WhileLoop-splice level has no such hazard: the group is one iteration
    of the spliced body, and a Pointwise op there (e.g. an accumulator's
    ``acc + p @ v_tile``) is SUPPOSED to fold each iteration's per-tile
    partial into the carry -- that folding, plus the carry-back across
    iterations, is exactly how the reduction completes over the whole
    loop. Flagging it as premature (or deferring it to copy_out) would
    treat the loop's own carry semantics as a bug.

    A WhileLoop-splice body op that writes one tile per iteration in place
    carries the per-iteration offset in its MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE
    target's own layout: upstream builds
    ``ReinterpretView(carry, size=[tile], stride=[...], offset=<stride>*u0)``
    and ``MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE.make_indexer`` delegates straight to
    it, so the store index comes out as ``6*d0 + d1 + 12*u0`` -- the tile's
    absolute address, correct as a statement of intent and exactly what
    planning above needs in order to place the tiled dim at all.

    But it must not survive into codegen. Once ``output_tiled_dims`` is set
    (just above), ``SpyreKernel._general_tile_advance`` emits a
    ``device_tile_advance_expr`` that already steps this write one whole
    tile per trip. Leaving the ``u0`` term in the index too would apply the

    ``device_coordinates`` -- which ``op_spec_validation``'s
    ``_check_symbol_consistency`` rejects, since it is not an
    ``iteration_space`` key.

    So rebase the target view to iteration 0 and let the advance own the
    step, mirroring what ``_copy_inner_fn`` does for the read side. The
    ``FixedLayout`` object being edited belongs solely to this
    ``ReinterpretView`` (verified: the carry buffer, the body placeholder
    and the graph output's own view each hold a distinct layout object), and
    the ``ReinterpretView`` itself is left in place -- see
    while_loop_bridge.py's ``_substitute_direct_input_refs`` docstring for
    why its identity and rank must not change. ``FixedLayout.offset`` is a
    plain attribute on a non-frozen class, unlike ``ReinterpretView``
    itself, so it can be rebound directly.

    Indirect (gather) reads are excluded -- they have no stageable tile; see

    A loop-internal op (own tile-sized layout) that reads a buffer produced
    outside its own outer loop group can never be made stick-compatible
    with it under AllSameNode: that producer's layout was fixed by a
    different loop group's (or no loop group's) constraints, sized to its
    own full extent, while op's own candidates are sized to its tile.

    This only applies to producers that go through coarse_tile's own
    candidate-layout machinery: a SpyreEmptyFallback buffer (coarse_tile's
    own full-extent accumulator, given a single generic_layout candidate and
    AnyInNode -- see _allocate_full_buffer -- that the optimizer can never
    relayout) or a ComputedBuffer with no loop_info (untiled, full-extent) or
    a different loop_group_id[0] (divided by a different group's loop_count
    -- e.g. the output of an earlier, different coarse-tile group's own copy
    op).

    Graph inputs (InputBuffer, including ConstantBuffer) are always
    full-extent and undivided, exactly like a SpyreEmptyFallback accumulator
    -- there is no loop_info question to ask, so they are always included.
    An older version of this docstring argued these could be skipped because
    insert_restickify's AllSameNode path "already reconciles a full-extent
    input against a tile-sized read." That reasoning predates the decision
    (see _insert_copy_op) to unconditionally insert a copy across any
    loop-group boundary that changes size (full <-> tile), and does not hold
    up under it: restickify only reconciles device layout/strides via a
    fresh spyre.restickify op; it never rewrites a consumer's *index
    expression*. A tiled op's own load index for a given read is sized to
    its tile regardless of what the producer is, so a direct read of a
    graph input inside the loop body is evaluated with a tile-scoped index
    against a full-size buffer -- the same indexing bug _insert_copy_op's
    write side had before that fix, just on the read side and against an
    external buffer instead of a freshly allocated one. See
    _insert_all_read_copy_ops and _find_outside_consumers (same outer-key

    reconstruct it from index expressions). Duplicated locally rather than
    imported to avoid a coarse_tile <-> insert_restickify import-order
    dependency; the two run at different, non-adjacent pipeline stages.

    Unlike insert_restickify's version, entries here also carry the
    full-buffer and tile-local strides for the swapped name (see
    _insert_all_read_copy_ops): the copy buffer being swapped in is physically
    smaller than the full buffer it replaces, so tiled_op's original index
    (affine in its own loop vars, using full_buf's stride coefficients) no
    longer resolves to a valid offset into it.

    The incoming `index` at call time is tiled_op's own inner_fn tracing
    through this exact load, so it is affine in whatever loop variables that
    particular trace happens to use -- inner_fn may be retraced multiple
    times (e.g. by scheduler fusion checks) with a *different* dummy
    variable each time (d0, i0, q0, ... have all been observed for the same
    load site), so a single precomputed replacement expression captured at
    _insert_all_read_copy_ops time would be wrong on every trace that doesn't
    happen to reuse those exact symbols. Instead, `index` is rescaled at
    call time: each additive term's coefficient is matched (by value) against
    full_strides to find its dimension, then replaced by that dimension's
    tile_strides coefficient -- this works for whatever free symbols this
    particular trace used, without needing to know them in advance.

    `index` is affine in some set of loop variables, with one additive term
    per dimension whose coefficient equals the matching entry in
    `full_strides` (plus, possibly, a constant offset term). Returns the
    same linear combination of the same variables with each dimension's
    coefficient replaced by the matching entry in `tile_strides`. Matching
    is by coefficient value rather than by variable identity because the
    variables `index` is expressed in are not known in advance -- see
    _NameSwapHandler.  When ``reject_ambiguous`` is true, a term that could
    name multiple equal-stride dimensions is accepted only if every match
    maps to the same target stride.

    Each additive term is matched against a candidate `full_stride` by
    dividing the term by it and checking the quotient is free of the
    stride's own symbols (see `_divides_evenly` below) -- NOT via
    `index.as_coefficients_dict()`, which only isolates a term's
    "coefficient" correctly when that coefficient is a plain number. When
    `full_strides` contains a genuinely symbolic stride (e.g. a level/tile
    symbol) and the matching term is `loop_var * symbolic_stride`, sympy
    normalizes that whole product into a single atom with numeric
    coefficient 1 -- `as_coefficients_dict()` would report the *entire
    product* as the "term" and never find a `full_strides` entry equal to
    1, silently failing to match a case this function is specifically
    meant to support.

    Two further subtleties in the matching, both because dimensions are
    identified by their stride *value* rather than their position:

    - An extent-1 dimension's stride can coincide with a larger dimension's
      stride (e.g. a size-[1, N] shape's dim-0 stride equals dim-1's full
      extent, same as a size-[M, N] shape's dim-0 stride). Matching
      smallest-remaining-first would let a degenerate extent-1 stride steal
      a match that belongs to a real, larger dimension. Matching
      largest-first instead defers ambiguity among small/degenerate strides
      as long as possible, since a larger stride can only coincide with
      another dimension of at least that size.
    - Two full_strides can be symbolically equal but differently-formed
      expressions (e.g. ``2*(s0 + 1)`` vs ``2*s0 + 2``) -- `_divides_evenly`
      falls back to a simplified quotient/difference check rather than
      relying on structural equality alone.

    That buffer gets exactly one candidate layout (sized to the full
    buffer), while sizing_op's own candidates are sized to its tile — the
    two can never be stick-compatible under AllSameNode.  Mirroring
    _insert_copy_op's write-side fix: insert a copy op that reads the full
    buffer's current tile slice (same index expression dep already
    describes, same loop_info as sizing_op so the per-iteration base
    address advances identically) and writes it into a fresh tile-sized
    buffer.

    The copy's own ranges/index must match dep (dep.var_names/dep.size), not
    sizing_op.data.ranges: for a Reduction, the read spans output dims plus
    the reduction dim, so dep's iteration space has more vars than the op's
    own output-shaped ranges.  The copy buffer's own layout gets fresh
    contiguous tile-local strides (it is a physically smaller allocation
    than full_buf, not an aliased view of it — see tile_strides below).

    Mirrors _allocate_full_buffer's isinstance(orig_layout, FixedTiledLayout)
    branch: when full_buf already carries a FixedTiledLayout (post-stickify
    call site), the copy gets a FixedTiledLayout too, with device_layout
    resized down from full_buf's own device_layout via _resize_device_layout
    (shrink direction, mirroring _divide_ranges's use of the same helper).
    Otherwise (pre-stickify call site) the copy gets a plain FixedLayout, and
    stickification (which runs later) fills device_layout in normally.

    insert_before_op is the plan's own insertion-point decision (see
    ReadCopyEntry.insert_before_op_name) -- it names the first
    (operations order) consuming op in the group and is authoritative
    for where the copy is spliced into `operations`, independent of
    sizing_op (which only supplies loop_info/ranges/origins here and may
    coincide with insert_before_op but is not guaranteed to by contract).

    The combine op reads both the partial result (tiled_op) and the current
    accumulation buffer and writes the combined value back into accum_buf via
    MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE.  It carries tiled_op's loop_group_id/
    loop_count/loop_tiled_dims/loop_tiled_reduction_dims (so the scheduler
    places it inside the same CountedLoopSchedulerNode), but its own
    freshly-derived tiled_dims_per_read/output_tiled_dims -- combine_buf's
    two reads and one write don't correspond positionally to tiled_op's own
    reads/write.

    tiled_op's own partial output is per-tile scratch reused in place every
    inner iteration, so the combine's read of it must not advance (see
    _fixed_level_extents).

    accum_buf's own reads/write depend on is_nested, because _caller_ passes a
    different buffer for each case (see _propagate_tiled_reduction_op):

    - Nested (is_nested=True): accum_buf is accum_tile, a per-outer-tile
      scratch buffer that a separate reduce-copy op drains into accum_full at
      the outer loop boundary -- accum_tile itself must not advance at any
      level, same as tiled_op's partial (_fixed_level_extents).
    - Flat (is_nested=False): accum_buf is accum_full itself, the real
      persistent output-shaped buffer with no separate copy op -- when a kept
      (non-reduction) output dim is tiled at some level, accum_full
      legitimately advances at that level so each iteration combines into the
      correct slice, exactly like _insert_copy_op's write side into full_buf
      (see _advancing_level_extents).

    Using _fixed_level_extents for accum_buf's reads/write unconditionally in
    both cases (as an earlier version of this function did) always pinned the
    flat case's mutation-write to the first slice, leaving every other slice
    stuck at the fill/identity value -- this previously surfaced as a
    spurious advancing-lx NotImplementedError once a since-removed per-buffer
    per_tile_fixed flag that had been masking it was taken away, and after
    that flag's removal regressed into silent wrong numerics instead

    the index cannot be decomposed (non-affine, or stride not in info.old_stride).

    Used by _RetileLoadIndexHandler and _NameAndIndexSwapHandler during real
    codegen.  Most incoming index coefficients are expressed in
    ``info.old_stride`` and are rewritten to ``info.new_stride``.  An outside
    view can, however, derive some coefficients from the full destination
    layout before its producer is redirected.  In the tile-to-full direction,
    ``preserve_target_stride_atoms`` keeps an atom whose coefficient exactly
    matches an unambiguous regular ``new_stride`` entry and exceeds the source
    tile's maximum physical offset (proving that it cannot be source-local).
    Remaining atoms still use ``compute_tile_index`` so view-combined
    tile-local coefficients retain the general decomposition supported by that
    helper.

    When ``consumer`` is given AND has no loop_info of its own (i.e. it is an
    "outside" consumer with no enclosing coarse-tile loop nest), any dim
    squeezed out of the old (tile-local) buffer but real in the new (full)
    buffer -- see _squeezed_retile_dims -- is added back as an explicit
    ``consumer``-own-symbol * new_stride term, since compute_tile_index
    cannot rescale a coefficient that isn't in the incoming index at all.
    Inside consumers (those with their own loop_info) are never patched this
    way: their incoming index is already derived from a real, enclosing loop
    nest via normal codegen and already carries a correct term for every
    real dimension -- adding another would double-count it. Only meaningful
    for the tile->full ("grow") direction (_NameAndIndexSwapHandler); the
    full->tile direction (_RetileLoadIndexHandler) never needs this --
    shrinking a buffer's own layout for a group-internal consumer doesn't
    lose dims from its index.

    The two handlers run in opposite directions:
    - _RetileLoadIndexHandler: full→tile (old_stride are the full strides,
      new_stride are the smaller tile strides).
    - _NameAndIndexSwapHandler: tile→full (old_stride are the tile strides,
      new_stride are the larger full strides).

    compute_tile_index is valid for both directions.  Its core,
    compute_tile_offset, does divmod(coeff, s) for each paired stride s in
    decreasing order.  Each atom's coefficient IS one of the old strides, so
    each divmod is exact (remainder zero).  Potential ambiguity from duplicate
    stride values is prevented by compute_tile_index's irregular-dimension
    filter: size==1 and stride==0 dimensions are excluded before pairing, and
    those are the only source of duplicate strides in a valid tensor layout.

    compute_tile_index uses var_ranges only as a key-set to distinguish loop
    variables from shape symbols.  We derive it from index.free_symbols so the
    call site never needs to know which prefix convention the calling inner_fn
    uses for its loop variables.

    applied to the reduction's result) wrapping a StorageBox wrapping the

    ReinterpretView, and when a ReinterpretView is found, repoint its own
