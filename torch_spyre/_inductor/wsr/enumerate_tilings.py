"""Enumerate the coarse tilings an op could take.

A *pure, unconsumed* enumerator for the coarse-tiling optimization.
Nothing calls it yet -- the solver that prices and chooses among these options
arrives separately. Its whole contract is to answer "what tilings could this op
legally take", exhaustively and deterministically, so the solver has a complete
candidate set to search.

"Legally" includes "can be lowered". Every option passes the lowering's own
resolver, ``scratchpad.coarse_tiling.try_resolve_tile_axis_loop_vars``, before
it is offered, so a spec the solver picks from this set cannot then fail in
``tile_spec_to_dim_hints`` -- and the predictor (``wsr.tile_prediction``), which
reads the same resolver, cannot refuse it on axis grounds either. A reduction
``host_dim`` is minted, sized and stick-checked in the frame that resolver reads
it in: a position in the op's *squeezed* reduction loop variables
(:func:`~.coarse_tile.reduction_loop_vars`). An op with a size-1 reduction dim
is offered no reduction tilings: Inductor mints no loop variable for that dim,
so the squeezed positions no longer line up with ``reduction_ranges``. The
resolver itself accepts a reduction axis on such an op, so this limits what is
offered, not what lowers.

The strategy is **exact divisors**: a split count is
admissible only if it divides its dim's extent exactly, because coarse tiling
emits equal-sized loop tiles. This is not a new rule -- it is exactly what
:func:`_split_candidates_for_host_dim` already computes for the span-overflow
path -- so this module *reuses* those predicates rather than restating them.
Two consequences of the strategy are visible to users and neither is a
bug: a prime extent is effectively untileable (its only divisors are 1 and
itself, and the self-split is a unit tile), and padding a dim to a composite
extent is the lever that opens divisors.

Reductions are enumerated here too, but **single-level only**: never nested with
an output axis and never two reduction dims at once. Those shapes are the ones
the reduction-tiling path gets wrong today, so the enumerator must not offer
them.

Two deliberate departures from the span-overflow path:

* **It fails closed on the stick host dim.** ``_split_candidates_for_host_dim``
  admits a *whole-stick* split of the stick-carrying dim, but applying such a
  tiling produces an undersized boundary ``full_buf`` and silently wrong results
  (the stick-dim upscale bug). So this enumerator drops the stick dim entirely
  rather than trusting the stick-alignment predicate the 448 path relies on.
* **It does not run on span pressure.** ``_candidate_host_dims`` only offers dims
  that relieve an overflowing span; enumerating from it would return the untiled
  option alone for an op under no pressure, and the solver would never tile it.
  This enumerates every legally-splittable non-stick dim regardless of
  pressure.
