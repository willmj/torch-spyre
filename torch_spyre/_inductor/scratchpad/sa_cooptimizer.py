"""Joint work-division + LX-layout simulated-annealing engine.

``SaCoOptimizingSolver`` is a third co-optimization engine alongside the
substrate's CP-SAT and DFS solvers. It anneals the joint state ``(pi, W)``:

* ``pi`` -- the layout permutation, held in a *composed* (not subclassed)
  :class:`PermutationBasedLayoutSolver` packer, because this loop mixes move
  types and scores a richer objective than the packer's own ``quality()``.
* ``W`` -- the work division, one :class:`DivisionConfig` per buffer.

Moves are reorder, atomic division flip, and region-recolor; each structural
move runs as a compound move+burst judged as a unit by one Metropolis test.
Region-recolor floods the residency relation bidirectionally from a splitting
anchor config, so the region *is* the flood's reach and boundaries emerge for
free; an edge with no compatible division becomes an accepted internal seam.
A flip proposes one axis's factor, one step; a recolor draws a splitting
division any number of axes away and floods it, which is the search's
long-range move. A generated source draws it by redrawing the current one, so
unlike a menu draw it depends on the state.

Best-seen over ``(pi, W)`` from the seed state (every op at its seed config,
``pi`` from FirstFit) keeps every returned state no worse than that baseline.

Determinism: a seeded ``Random`` over index-ordered domains and the integer
fixed-point score make a run bit-for-bit reproducible.

    ``chosen[i]`` holds one of these rather than a menu position, so a config the

    Equality and hashing are :attr:`key`'s, which makes two configs equal exactly
    when they are the same *choice*. The key is normally the division's split
    map (:func:`_canonical_key`), so a *generated* config compares equal to the
    menu entry making the same choice, and a generated set can be deduplicated
    or memoized by it.

    The exception is a clone's menu. Its entries are synthesized one per
    consumer out of that consumer's own iteration symbols, which are positional
    and repeat across ops, so two entries can share a split map while slicing
    the buffer differently. Merging them would report a division compatible
    with a clone entry the pair table never checked it against, so a position
    repeating an earlier split map ``position_disambiguates``: its key carries
    ``menu_index`` too. An op's menu is deduplicated by split map, so a buffer
    that generates never needs this.

    The key is derived and never supplied, so it cannot disagree with the
    config it identifies. It is derived once, so ``division``, held by
    reference, is treated as frozen: nothing mutates a division after the menu
    is built, and a mutation would leave the key stale.

    ``menu_index`` is provenance: the position this config came from in its
    buffer's ``core_divisions``, or ``None`` for a *generated* config. Only the
