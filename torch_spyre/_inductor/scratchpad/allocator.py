        Exception: ops data-connected to a sliced in-place mutation (a constant-
        offset write, e.g. ``x[:, 32:96] = ...``) are pinned to their upstream
        (fixed) division. Re-slicing any op fused into the offset write's SDSC
        makes the deeptools scheduler reject it (``DtException: "There must be at
        least one valid candidate"``), the root cause of the
        ``slice_stick_mutation_*`` failures. Keeping the fixed division there
        matches the schedulable slicing the greedy path uses; it costs only a
        division optimization when that division also satisfies hard
        work-division constraints. Otherwise LX planning raises ``Unsupported``
        rather than committing an illegal division. See
        ``utils.ops_in_offset_mutation_component``.
