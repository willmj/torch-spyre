        The child (which writes at ``child_start``) reuses the parent's storage,

        - the parent is a pointwise-eligible read input of the child;
        - matching device layout (so the storage can alias);
        - single handoff tick (``parent_end == child_start``: the same op that reads
          the parent as its last use writes the child), the invariant the solvers'
          in-place relaxation relies on (see ``_check_in_place_relationships``).
          Callers pass ticks widened by counted-loop lifetime overrides
          (``_handoff_child_start`` / ``_handoff_parent_end``), so a buffer kept
          live across a loop never qualifies;

        If it picks a non-empty tiling for any op, ``CoarseTilingPass`` applies

        plan stay bit-identical to today. When it does, the op is offered the
        output-axis tilings it could take, minus any whose per-core read span
        would still exceed the read-distance limit (``MAX_SPAN_BYTES``); the

        - **Restickify** offers nothing: no tiling form is correct
          post-stickification.
        - **Everything else** -- pointwise, reduction, *and matmul* -- offers only
          output-axis tilings (``is_clean``). That single filter, plus the

          the numerically fragile forms for every op kind, so matmul needs no
          guard of its own: a matmul's K/reduction axis is not an output axis and
          is excluded (reduction tiling routes through the accumulator/combine
          path, ~2 orders off CPU -- see ``_mlp_case``), and its N/stick dim is
          never emitted. What remains for a matmul is row/M-axis output tiling,
          which is correct and backend-accepted (see
          ``test_hint_matmul_row_tiling``), so a discovered tiling on that axis
          is honored the same as for any other op.
