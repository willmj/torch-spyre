"""Joint core-division + LX-placement solver built on OR-Tools CP-SAT
(``config.layout_solver == "cpsat"``).

Selects each buffer's core division and its LX scratchpad placement in one
constraint model over :class:`CoreDivisionBuffer`s:

* **Joint core-division.** ``size`` is the *total* device footprint; a ``div``
  var indexes the buffer's candidate divisions (from
  ``enumerate_work_division_candidates``) and ``AddElement`` ties the chosen
  index to the per-core footprint (``eff_size = size / output_partition``) and
  total core usage (``cores = cores_used``, including any reduction-axis split).
* **Slicing-match residency gate.** A resident buffer's division must induce the
  same per-core slicing as *every* consumer's, using the precomputed
  ``cd_parent_matches`` pairs over the ``parents`` (producer/consumer) edges; a
  buffer with no consumer, or a consumer with no compatible pair, can never
  reside (``_CoreDivisionBufferWithCpVars.constrain_residency``).
* **Placement** is a global ``AddNoOverlap2D`` over optional rectangles
  (``[start_time, end_time) x [offset, offset + eff_size)``, present iff
  resident). In-place reuse (``in_place_parents`` -> per-edge ``merge_vars``) is
  encoded by *shortening the child's lifetime* by the single handoff tick when
  the merge fires, so the parent and its in-place child abut in time and may
  legally share an offset; the single-tick-overlap invariant
  (``_check_in_place_relationships``) makes this exact. The parent keeps its
  full lifetime, so the footprint above a smaller child stays protected on the
  handoff tick (``_add_no_overlap_2d``).
* **Objective** (lexicographic, in ``_run``; each level locks the prior
  level's optimum as a constraint before optimizing the next). *Residency
  is the hard priority.* It first minimizes total **HBM transfer traffic** via
  ``spill_cost(b) * (1 - in_buffer)`` -- the *differential* traffic a spill adds
  over residency (resident buffers contribute 0). An intermediate costs
  ``(num_consumers + 1) * size`` (the producer's HBM write, which residency turns
  into a free LX write, plus one re-read per consumer); a graph input drops the
  producer write it never had and the clone-in read residency cannot avoid
  (``(num_consumers - 1) * size``); a graph output drops its unavoidable
  write-out (``num_consumers * size``). This puts as much in LX as possible
  and chooses whatever division serves that (even no split, if that is what lets
  a buffer match its consumers and reside). It then *holds that residency
  optimum* and maximizes total core usage (``sum_b cores_b``) so every buffer --
  resident or spilled, the latter free of the slicing gate -- takes its most
  parallel division. Parallelism never costs a spill. It finally *holds the
  parallelism optimum* and breaks the remaining ties toward a **balanced**
  division by minimizing the summed squared split factors
  (``sum_b sum_axis split**2``): among divisions that use the same number of
  cores, one spreading the split across more axes with smaller factors scores
  lower than one that hammers a single axis (``2x2`` over ``4x1``). This only
  refines the division the allocator commits -- it can never spill a buffer or
  reduce its core count. Op shape is not yet visible to the solver, so this is a
  proxy for balance rather than a full cost model.

After the solve, ``_justify`` slides each in-place-merged placement unit down to
the lowest free address, squeezing out float gaps the search leaves. It coarsens
a merged unit to one rectangle over the union of its members' lifetimes, which is
conservative enough that the squeeze can occasionally need more room than the
solver's own answer; when it would not fit, the solver's offsets are kept.

**LX relayouts** ride on the same machinery. The allocator hands the solver one
``RelayoutCopyBuffer`` per relayout group (a source and one destination per-core
view, however many consumers read it), live from the group's first consumer to
its last; the copy's residency IS the decision to shuffle, its rectangle sits in
the same 2D no-overlap as every other buffer, and its price is an ordinary term
of the shared objective (``RelayoutCopyBuffer.cost_term``: the fitted shuffle
cost of the source's chosen division, charged while the copy is resident). What
this module adds is only the coupling the data cannot carry
(``_constrain_relayout_copies`` and the relaxed gate in
``constrain_residency``): a resident copy needs its source resident under a
division it was priced for, a consumer reads the copy only under a division
pair its candidates list, and a resident copy serves at least one consumer. The
gate thus becomes "slicing match, or a resident copy serving this edge". Under
the fallback objective a shuffle is unpriced and would look free, so every copy
is pinned out there.

The same model also serves plain :class:`LifetimeBoundBuffer`s via
``plan_layout`` (the ``MemoryPlanSolver`` contract the placement-only allocator
calls). Those buffers carry no candidate divisions, so the division-dependent
pieces -- per-core sizing, the slicing-match gate, the merge division gate and
the parallelism and balance objectives -- simply drop out: the
footprint is the buffer's ``size`` and the solve reduces to minimising HBM
traffic under the 2D no-overlap with in-place reuse. Residency is then gated
only by capacity and by the allocator's own ``residency_reason`` bars (which
both paths honour, since that field lives on the base buffer). That
specialisation lives on the buffer wrappers (``_LifetimeBufferWithCpVars`` and
its joint subclass ``_CoreDivisionBufferWithCpVars``), so the solver methods
below are written once against whichever wrapper ``_wrap`` chose.

        A cut is a tiled op whose value has to be published into a full-sized
        buffer because some consumer sits outside its loop nest -- the
        ``kind="copy_out"`` classification ``_plan_tiling_propagation`` makes
        later, expressed over the solver's own division variables so it can be
        ranked *while* the tiling is being chosen rather than discovered after.

        Each candidate's loop nest (:attr:`TileSpec.level_counts`) is interned
        to a small integer id (the untiled nest is always 0, so ``loop_id !=
        0`` means "tiled"), and ``add_element`` ties a buffer's id to its
        chosen division exactly as ``eff_size`` and ``cores`` are already tied.
        Which ops share a nest is decided over op order, not the edge alone:
        see :meth:`_tiling_group_ids`. A consumer that shares its producer's
        nest reads it one tile at a time, so their chosen divisions must be a
        ``cd_parent_matches`` pair, whose views are owned per (tile, core); a
        pair that is not must be split by a cut. A tiled graph output, or a
        tiled buffer with no modelled consumer (one read only by an extern
        kernel), is a cut unconditionally, since its value must reach HBM
        either way.

        Returns an empty list when nothing carries a non-empty spec, which is
        every path except the joint solve with ``auto_coarse_tiling`` on, so the

        presence (``in_buffer``), so spilled buffers drop out for free.

        In-place reuse is handled *inside* this constraint rather than by
        relaxing it: an active incoming merge shortens the child's time interval
        by the single handoff tick it shares with the parent
        (``start -> start + 1``). The parent and child then abut in time at the
        same offset (pinned equal by the merge), which the 2D constraint accepts
        as non-overlapping -- so the child legally reuses the parent's slot. With
        no active merge the child keeps its full lifetime and the shared-offset
        placement is correctly forbidden, exactly as the pairwise encoding did.

        It is the *child* that gives up the tick, never the parent: the parent's
        rectangle has to keep covering the handoff tick at full footprint. The
        child may be smaller than its parent (the placement-only model only
        requires ``child.size <= parent.size``), and the bytes above the child
        are still holding parent data that is read on that tick, so they are not
        free for a third buffer. Shortening the parent instead would expose them
        -- and a parent whose whole lifetime is that one tick would drop out of
        the propagator entirely, exposing its full slot.

        ``AddAtMostOne`` on the incoming edges bounds the shortening at one tick.
        A child whose entire lifetime is the handoff tick degenerates to a
        zero-width box the 2D propagator ignores, which is safe here: the tick is
