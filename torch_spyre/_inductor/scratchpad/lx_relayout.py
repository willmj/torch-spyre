    """One priced way for a divided producer to stay LX-resident for one consumer.

    Born in the allocator's enumeration (``_cd_parent_relayouts``) and carried
    unchanged through the CP-SAT model, the extraction and the commit path: the
    solver keys its pair literal by this record, extraction attaches the solved
    placement (:class:`ChosenRelayout`), and the commit path folds the fired
    members of one fired group into a :class:`LXRelayoutPlan`
    (:class:`FiredRelayoutGroup`). Nothing downstream re-derives a view, a core
    count or a price from primitives, so a change to what a relayout *is*
    (another lowering kind, a measured footprint) is a change to this record
    and to the enumeration that builds it, nowhere else.

    ``group`` identifies the DESTINATION per-core view of ``parent``, interned
    per parent by the allocator for one solve: every candidate that lands on
    the same view of the same parent shares one shuffle and one LX destination
    (``RelayoutCopyBuffer``), so the solver prices and places the group once,
    not per edge.

    Each view carries the physical core count it was built for (every core's
    owner slot within its split), so ``num_cores`` is the source view's and
    ``destination_num_cores`` the destination view's; the enumeration's
    ``cores_used`` gates guarantee the views were built for the divisions
    being paired.

    ``source_footprint_bytes`` / ``destination_footprint_bytes`` are the
    per-core LX spans of the two views (:func:`partition_footprint`, the bound
    the committed path reserves for a relayout member since #3440), measured
    once at enumeration: the copy buffer is sized from the destination span and
    the plan hands both to the allocator, so the solver never reserves less for
    a shuffle than the committed path would.

      differently spelled slot expression cannot masquerade as movement;
    - ``movement_supported``, the committed path's own gate (#3440), admits
      what the emitter can move: uniform permutations, grouped gathers and
      grouped broadcasts, so the solver never prices a movement the emitter
      cannot execute; the enumeration adds the collector's consumer rules
      (:func:`core_domain_rejection`, :func:`grouped_gather_rejection`) on top. A
      grouped movement is priced by the same law as a permutation of the same
      tensor on the SOURCE's cores, keyed on the finer side's geometry as
      always: ``cores=num_cores`` makes the law's per-core bytes the source
      slice, which is what every destination core receives in a broadcast. The

      shuffle's marginal cost at or below that law (<= 0.3 us gathers, <= 1.6

    - a governing split outside the law's fitted range [2, 8] is DECLINED, not
      clamped: the reporting path clamps because the shuffle it prices already
      exists, but the solver must never be offered an option at a price the
      law was not fitted for.

    The price is ``relayout_ns`` on a minimal feature vector - the same function
    the reporting path uses, so the two paths cannot drift.

    Each view must be built FOR its own core count (every core's owner slot
    within its split): the source for ``num_cores``, the destination for
    ``destination_num_cores`` (the source's count when omitted). The caller's
    cores_used gates guarantee that, and ``_core_slices`` asserts it rather
