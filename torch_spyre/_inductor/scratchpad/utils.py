    An LX-pinned buffer is addressed by a single base (in SDSC codegen the
    ``start_address`` is ``layout.allocation["lx"]``); unlike the HBM path, a
    per-access slice offset is *not* folded into that base, and strided
    partial reads of a multi-dim buffer mis-address. Both failure modes read
    less than the full buffer per access:

    - multi-offset: ``x[:, 0:512] + x[:, 512:1024]`` — two half reads that
      both resolve to the LX base, yielding ``x0 + x0``;
    - partial slice: ``x[:, :, 0:64]`` — a sub-extent read that mis-addresses

    to LX-pin. We are deliberately conservative: an unprovable (symbolic)
    footprint is treated as unsafe, costing a missed optimization but never
    correctness.

    Why a guard and not a codegen fix: the root cause is that the SDSC LX
    address path (compute_ops._start_addr_data) uses only ``start_address``,
    dropping the per-access view offset that the HBM path folds in via
    ``core_idx_to_slice_offset``. It is a codegen gap, not a hardware limit.
    But folding ``sum(offsets)`` into the LX base only fixes part of it: the
    view offset interacts with per-core work-slicing (at multi-core the split
    changes which coordinate is constant vs per-core), so a correct fix must
    reconcile the view offset with the per-core LX work-slice geometry rather
    than add a single constant. Until that lands, the guard keeps such buffers

    LX addresses are never registered as ``affine.apply`` symbols in the SDSC
    JSON (see ``compute_ops.py``'s ``is_tiled_lx`` check), so a buffer that
    advances per loop iteration has no way to express its address change if
    pinned to LX. This derives the same answer ``is_tiled_lx`` derives, but
    earlier (at IR/allocation time) and directly from ``loop_info``, letting
    the allocator exclude such buffers from LX candidacy up front instead of
    crashing at codegen time.

    Note this checks ``output_tiled_dims`` -- whether *this op's own write*
    advances -- not ``loop_tiled_dims``, which only says the op is tiled at
    all. A loop-internal buffer (e.g. drained by a copy op every iteration)
    can be tiled yet have its own write pinned at a fixed address; such a
    buffer is LX-eligible.

    Also checks ``squeezed_advance_output``: a dim tiled down to per-tile
    extent 1 (e.g. a coarse-tiled batch dim with one tile per iteration) is
    squeezed out of the write's own index entirely, so it never appears in
    ``output_tiled_dims`` even though the write's device address genuinely
    advances every iteration (see ``loop_info.py``'s
    ``squeezed_advance_output`` docstring). Missing this let a

    """Names of ops data-connected to a sliced in-place mutation that writes at
    a constant non-zero offset (e.g. ``x[:, 32:96] = ...``).

    Such a mutation and everything fused with it land in one SDSC. The offset
    write's codegen assumes the target buffer keeps the slicing the eager path
    chose; if the co-optimizing allocator re-slices any op in that fused kernel
    (a different core division), the deeptools scheduler can no longer place the
    offset write and aborts the compile (``DtException: "There must be at least
    one valid candidate"``, ``L3DlOpsScheduler.cpp:1196``). This is the root
    cause of the ``slice_stick_mutation_*`` co-optimizing-allocator failures --
    the division change, *not* LX residency (the abort reproduces with pinning
    fully disabled).

    The caller pins every op in this set to its upstream (fixed) division, so
    the offset-write SDSC keeps the schedulable slicing the greedy /
    placement-only path uses. Fusion boundaries are unknown at planning time, so
    the SDSC is over-approximated by the undirected data-dependency component
    containing the offset write: producer chain (the value written), the
    mutation target it aliases, and the consumers of that target. Over-approxi-
    mation only forgoes a division optimization (correct, never a new failure --
    a fixed division is exactly what greedy uses).

    Coverage-aware via :func:`_writes_at_constant_offset`: symbolic per-core
    offsets (coarse tiling) are not offset writes, so no component is seeded and
    coarse tiling is not constrained.
