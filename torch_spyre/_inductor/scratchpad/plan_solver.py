    Defines the data fields required for a plan solver.

    ``uses`` is the strictly increasing list of operation indices at which the
    buffer is accessed (as returned by ``calculate_liveness``).  It is normally
    non-empty, and callers that read ``start_time``/``end_time`` require that,
    since those properties index into it; the FirstFit/BestFit scoring divides
    by ``len(uses)`` plus a write bonus, which is non-zero for a computed buffer
    even when ``uses`` is empty.  Emptiness is nevertheless allowed at
    construction -- see :meth:`__post_init__` for the registration state that
    needs it.  ``first_use_is_read`` is True for graph inputs (all accesses are
    reads) and False for computed buffers (first access is a write, all
    subsequent accesses are reads).

    Both properties of ``uses`` are asserted in ``__post_init__``.  Strictness
    is what makes ``read_count`` trustworthy: one entry per accessing op means
    that for a computed buffer ``read_count == 0`` is exactly "written, never
    read", which the in-place invariants rely on (see
    :func:`check_in_place_parent_is_read`).  A repeated index would describe a
    buffer written and read by the same op, i.e. with a single live tick, and
    would let such a buffer pass as an in-place parent.

    ``start_time`` and ``end_time`` are convenience properties derived from
    ``uses`` and widened by optional counted-loop lifetime overrides.

    A group is one (source buffer, destination per-core view) pair, however many
    consumers read it. Modelling its destination as an ordinary buffer is what
    keeps the relayout decision solver-agnostic:

    * **The decision is residency.** ``sym_is_lx`` of this buffer means "the
      shuffle fires", so any engine that decides residency can decide relayouts.
    * **Placement comes free.** The copy occupies real LX from the group's first
      consumer to its last inside whatever no-overlap or packing the engine
      already runs, so capacity vetoes it like any other buffer. One copy serves
      every consumer of the group: the model never re-shuffles a view it
      released, it spills the source instead.
    * **The price is a plain objective term.** :meth:`cost_term` charges the
      shuffle, priced by the SOURCE's chosen division, through the shared sympy
      objective, so every engine charges it the same way and none needs a
      private cost binding.

    What an engine must add itself is the coupling this buffer cannot express as
    data: a resident copy needs its source resident under a priced division, a
    consumer reads the copy only under a division pair its candidates list, and
    a resident copy must serve at least one consumer (``CpSatLayoutSolver``
    carries the CP-SAT encoding; the annealer does not decide relayouts yet and
    is never handed a copy, see ``CoOptimizingAllocator``).

    ``size`` is the destination's per-core span (the candidates'
    ``destination_footprint_bytes``, the bound the committed path reserves for
    a relayout destination) times the DESTINATION's core count, and
    ``core_divisions`` holds one division sliced that many ways, so the
    per-core footprint every engine derives (``size / output_partition``) is
    exactly that span. For a broadcast the copy therefore lives on the
    consumer's cores while its source stays on fewer. ``parents`` is
    deliberately empty: the source edge is a relayout coupling, not a
    slicing-match edge, and listing it would make engines that gate residency on
    ``cd_parent_matches`` refuse the source outright.
