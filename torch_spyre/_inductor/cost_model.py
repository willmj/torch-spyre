"""A simple, high-level analytical cost model for Spyre kernels.

Goal: predict *relative* device latency from the "after-pre-scheduling"
LoopLevel IR to guide higher-level optimization. Deliberately NOT a simulator.

Model (per fused bundle / single-op kernel):

    T       = compute + mem - overlap_gamma * min(compute, mem) + split
    compute = matmul_compute + reduction_elems / (cores * reduction_rate)
    mem     = HBM / (eff * s_lx)

    HBM = [ (R+W)/BW + alpha*min(R,W) ] + spill + write_extra
    s_lx = min(1, (512KB/ws)**0.15)   for a coarse-tiled kernel with ws > 512KB   (else 1)

  where R = HBM bytes READ (inputs), W = HBM bytes WRITTEN (outputs). LX-resident
  traffic is treated as ~free. ``eff`` (<=1) derates the MEMORY term for OUTPUT-dim
  (pointwise) coarse-tiling that shrinks each core's per-tile height; ``s_lx`` (<=1) further
  derates it when the per-core working set overflows LX (spilled traffic runs slower).
  ``compute`` includes matmul work (see below) and the element-throughput bound of a
  dependent fused reduction pipeline. A genuine-reduction cross-core ring term,
  and a per-iteration coarse-tiling loop overhead (c_loop*L), once lived here but are dropped
  (the ring is <=~5ns sub-noise; c_loop had no current op to validate it). For a normal untiled
  non-matmul kernel eff = 1, s_lx = 1 and compute = 0, so this reduces to the bandwidth model.

- ``fill`` ~= 0: the golden kernel has no fixed term (section-A intercept ~0; the old
  ~20us "fixed" was a separate non-deterministic Memset/host-setup bucket, not kernel).
- ``BW_PEAK`` ~150 GB/s (== bytes/ns) is the PEAK HBM bandwidth, reached when traffic is
  one-directional (read-only or write-only). HBM is a shared bus that must turn around
  between reading and writing, so a kernel doing BOTH pays a penalty on the overlap.
- ``alpha * min(R, W)`` is that read/write turnaround penalty. min(R,W) is the overlap:
  0 for pure read or pure write (no switching), maximal at a balanced 1R+1W. This gives
  the measured V-shaped effective BW -- ~150 read-only, dipping to ~105 at balanced,
  back up for write-only -- with one extra constant instead of a second bandwidth.
  Verified on the B-F profiler sweep: ~2% error on core pointwise + reductions, ~7%
  overall (turnaround) vs ~11% for an additive two-rate. Using a single aggregate
  BW_PEAK is the "shared HBM" assumption (rung-5: core-independent for >=2 cores).
- A DL16 transport with short strided source runs can be limited by DMA request
  throughput or, for a RESTICKIFY, the per-core transpose pipeline, not aggregate bytes.
  Its device access and candidate division determine the contiguous source run;
  hardware burst limits determine the request count. Only time exceeding the
  existing balanced-copy charge is added, after bundle compute overlap. Tile size
  and repetition scale the work without selecting a special-case cost law. See
  ``docs/source/compiler/restickify_cost_model.md`` for measurements and limitations.
- memory traffic counts each tensor-arg's bytes once, attributed to HBM or LX by
  its allocation. LX-placed tensors don't touch HBM, and their LX traffic is treated
  as ~free (the measured per-pass LX cost is below run-to-run noise). The exception is
  a GRAPH BOUNDARY transfer (a graph input's read, a graph output's write): the planner
  pins such a buffer by CLONING it, and the clone still moves those bytes through HBM
  (``ArgTraffic.is_boundary``; issue #4271). A graph output's write stays charged in its
  producer's bundle when LX-resident. A resident graph input's READERS are served from
  LX like any other resident arg; the clone's own load is a separate CLONE-IN term
  (``ArgTraffic.clone_in_elems``), charged to the first bundle that reads the input,
  since one clone serves the whole graph (``charge_boundary_reads_once`` clears
  ``owns_boundary_charge`` on the rest, keeping them de-duplicable). The clone is its
  own read-only DSC, so the term is priced at BW_PEAK OUTSIDE the bundle's turnaround and
  compute overlap, like an LX relayout copy (measurement in ``predict_ops``). Broadcast inputs
  are loaded ONCE and reused across the broadcast dim, so they are counted at their own
  (one-row/-col) DEVICE size -- NOT scaled up to the output size (the rung-6 runs proved
  a core does not re-read the operand per output element), but NOT dropped to zero
  either (it is still a real one-time load). That one load is tiny vs the output, so the
  bcast/mulbcast runs still land ~on the 2-pass latency. They are flagged (``broadcast``
  in :class:`ArgTraffic`) for visibility. The "once, not per core" count is VERIFIED on
  device (rung-G reload probe, cores=32, R=64): bcast (b[1,C]) ~= bcastcol (b[R,1]) ~=
  30-33us, both far below the full 3-pass add (52us). A per-core reload would have added
  ~cores*C and pushed bcast up toward add; it did not -- so the operand costs a single
  load regardless of how the work splits across cores.
- NON-SHARED MATMUL operands are the exception (``ArgTraffic.replication``): a bmm whose core split
  lies on a dim an operand does not index (M-split -> B, N-split -> A) makes every core
  in that split load its own full copy of the operand's slice from HBM. The grouped
  LX-relayout sweep (2026-09-09, 43 gather/broadcast rows, replication 2-16) measured
  the consumer-from-HBM time as ~2.5us + f*B at 60-67 GB/s -- f times the one-load
  bytes -- and the once-per-input count under-predicted the demote penalty 10-40x.
  Those loads also run at a PER-CORE ceiling (~2.3 GB/s per core; flat in rows per
  core and in core count, rows-per-core ladder 2026-09-10), so they are priced as
  per-core bytes over ``mm_replicated_read_gbps_per_core`` rather than at BW_PEAK.
  Residency removes all f loads; a resident graph input adds only its one clone-in load.
  Shared matmul inputs (``broadcast``) instead count one physical HBM load plus
  delivery time based on how many cores consume it. This accounting applies to
  both matmul models; the bundled model's large-output-tile reread term remains
  separate and is not refitted here.

Byte counts use each arg's DEVICE layout (stick-padded ``device_size``), not the torch
logical shape -- so a reduction's reduced input is naturally full-sized and stick
rounding is captured. REDUCTIONS are a tiny WRITE + a full READ, so they run at a read
rate. That rate is NOT flat: it falls with ROWS (op-independent -- read/sum/amax/mean/
sumall collapse to one curve), ``reduction_read_bw = min(150, 114+61*exp(-ROWS/3700))``,
applied to a STANDALONE row-reduction (single op; a fused softmax stays on bw_peak so its
input dedup is not broken; ``sumcol`` uses reduce_outer). (A cross-core ring-combine term
for a split reduced axis was dropped as sub-noise -- provably <=~5ns on us kernels.)

MATMUL (reduction_type batchmatmul) is priced by one of two independent
implementations, switched on ``CostParams.use_bundled_cost_model``:

- UPSTREAM (``use_bundled_cost_model=False``): the computation and partial-sum part of
  ``work_division._matmul_execution_cost``, shared with the work-division planner.
  Standalone split-ranking preferences are excluded: they are not operation times.
  It is called with ``include_hbm=False``. Its own
  HBM-traffic term is dropped because the bundle memory term below already charges the
  operand/output bytes, and does so LX-aware; charging both double-counts memory.
  ``predict_ops`` also charges shared-input delivery. CP-SAT uses this model.

- BUNDLED (``use_bundled_cost_model=True``): the original device-calibrated model,
  kept alongside the above rather than deleted. Adds a compute term that OVERLAPS the
  HBM term: the engine streams operands while the array works, so the kernel takes the
  LONGER of the two, not their sum: ``T = max(compute, HBM)``, with
  ``compute = MACs / cores / (mac_peak * pt_eff)`` (MACs = M*N*K, mac_peak=1140
  SUSTAINED). The matmul HBM uses a SINGLE rate = the copy peak (150) plus an operand
  RE-READ "tile spill": ``(|A|+|B|)*f(area)`` at that rate, f a saturating log of the
  per-core output-tile area (M/m)*(N/n) past the on-chip capacity ~64K elems). A
  default-layout BMM (both rank-3 operands on the compiler-default device tile order)
  runs the systolic array at a slower calibrated rate; see ``_matmul_mac_peak``. See
  ``_matmul_ns_bundled`` and the individual ``CostParams`` fields (``mac_peak_per_core_ns``,
  ``mm_spill_*``, ``mm_split_*``, ``mm_bw_*``, ``bmm_*``) for the fitted constants.

COARSE-TILING (fused kernel, e.g. ``softmax_row_tiling``): a coarse-tiled op is ONE fused
kernel with intermediates kept in LX -- NOT a sum of per-op kernels. Two things follow.
(1) HBM = distinct EXTERNAL inputs ONCE + outputs once (``_fused_hbm_bytes``): softmax
reads ``arg0`` in both ``amax`` and ``sub``, but the fused kernel loads it from HBM once
and serves the 2nd read on-chip -- the naive per-op sum double-counts it (~+25% at the
floor; at the floor softmax runs at ~100 GB/s = the balanced-copy rate, i.e. 1 read +
1 write, confirming the once-count). (2) UNDERFILL: tiling an output dim cuts each core's
per-tile SIZE -- rpc = ROWS/(cores*tiles) rows of COLS -- and a small tile underfills the
streaming pipeline. ``coarse_underfill_eff = min(cap, (rpc/r_full)**exp *
(COLS/col_ref)**col_exp)`` (cap~1.08, r_full~7.9 at col_ref 2048, exp~0.50, col_exp~0.38),
SEPARATE from the matmul ``pt_eff``. Re-fit 2026-08-11 on 48 tiled softmax rows at
cores=32 spanning rpc 2..256 AND COLS 128..4096; the width term is that re-fit's finding
and REPLACES the earlier rows-only reading, whose cross-COLS control (2048 vs 4096) sat
entirely inside the plateau and so could not see a width dependence. It remains a
tile-SIZE effect, not a tile-COUNT one (four T=4..32 points at rpc=16 cost the same).
KNOWN residuals: at cores 8 and 16 the memory term has no core-count scaling at all, so a
coarse-tiled softmax there is UNDER-predicted by 30-50% (identified and controlled --
matched tile shape, tile count ruled out -- but deliberately unmodeled; see the report);
and when the per-core WORKING SET overflows the
practically available LX (~512 KB/core) the intermediates SPILL to HBM. The extractor already
counts those spilled bytes as HBM (they show up read+written), so it is NOT a byte miss -- but
that spilled traffic runs SLOWER than the modeled rate, so the effective bandwidth is DERATED
(``_lx_spill_bw_derate``: BW *= (cap/ws)**0.15 for ws>cap). Softmax-calibrated
(10.7%->6.0% RMS on softmax_row_tiling, 32 cores, tiles>=2, n=60),
gated to non-matmul coarse tiling. See report S14.

ACCESS-PATTERN effective-BW overrides (db_sweep; fold turnaround into one measured rate).
STICK-PLANE TRANSPORTS -- a `clone` reorganizing the stick layout, parallelized by splitting
the stick-plane dim sp = C/64 across the 32 cores. Effective BW falls with the per-row
strided stick gather -- more planes (sp) and a longer gather stride (more rows R) -- so cat0,
transpose_outer and cat1 SHARE one form, clamp(a - b*log2(sp) - d*log2(R), floor, bw_peak),
with per-op constants (``tx_*``): cat0 a steep untiled gather, transpose_outer a gentle tiled
block-transpose (calibrated at its best middle dim M=8; M!=8 flagged), cat1 nearly flat
(copies stored outermost -> contiguous). ``transpose`` is a hardware restickify (stick
swapped) -> flat ``bw_restickify_gbps`` ~116; "reduce_outer" sumcol (cross-row reduce) ~113.
cat0/transpose carry an ``OpFeatures.hbm_pattern`` from the extractor; cat1/transpose_outer
are detected structurally from the logical reshape (``_transport_kind``). (A dependent multi-op
chain like add3/add4 costs more than its byte count -- a read-after-write ACROSS op
boundaries: a program-level effect, not a single-op cost, so NOT modeled here.) Transports land
within ~6%. BROADCAST-operand ops (copy/bcast/bcastcol/mulbcast: a full input + a small
broadcast operand) run ~118 GB/s -- ``bw_broadcast_gbps`` (mechanism open). ``write``
(b[1,C]+c[R,1], BOTH operands broadcast -> outer-product) is slow + super-linear; modeled by an
KNOWN residual (not yet modeled): transpose_outer away from M=8 (peaks at M~8); reductions
~-15% at large ROWS (stick-inflated scattered output write).

CALIBRATION NOTE: the golden per-op measurement is the torch.profiler "Self SPYRE"
(sdsc_fused) KERNEL device time -- NOT our old SPYRE_PROFILE_SYNC min (which folded in a
non-deterministic Memset/host-setup bucket, the source of the obsolete ~20us fill).

Parameters live in :class:`CostParams`, calibrated from device measurements
(``examples/run_cost_model_plan.sh``).

    # already batch-outer. It is reachable only behind an opt-in layout preference that
    # the compiler does not enable by default, so nothing it emits today uses it.
    # Pricing all four operand combinations cost three constants and an additive form
    # for configurations that never ship; that was removed in favour of the single
    # default-layout rate above. The measurement stands and is kept in the database; the
    # non-default runs are excluded from scoring (`eval_model.in_scope`). A 3d-2d
    # PROJECTION bmm (one rank-3 operand, one shared 2D operand) runs far faster than a
    # full both-batched bmm. Two rates, keyed on batch size. MECHANISM: OPEN. The
    # obvious story -- "the 2D operand loads once and is reused, so it escapes the
    # per-batch re-gather" -- is WRONG, or at least already paid for: that operand is
    # tagged `broadcast=True` with `loop_factor=1`, so the byte count ALREADY charges it
    # once, and charging it again as a rate would double-book. Two further facts
    # contradict a pure amortisation story: (a) all 43 measured rank-3 operands are in
    # the SLOW default order, for which the layout-additivity term's own rate is 235
    # MAC/ns/core -- 2.6x below what 3d2d actually sustains, so the two shipped
    # mechanisms disagree about the same physical configuration; and (b) amortising a
    # once-loaded operand should get BETTER with more batches, whereas the measured rate
    # STEPS DOWN above B=4. These are empirical rates with the mechanism unresolved, and
    # they are labelled as such deliberately. THE B STEP IS REAL, not a shape confound
    # (an earlier flat-rate version of this term claimed otherwise and was refuted).
    # Per-GMAC cost normalised to B=4, within shape and at an identical 4x8 split:
    # 1024x1024x1024 -> 1.136/1.000/1.352/1.384 and 1024x2048x1024 ->

    # at the step (768->1024 KB, 1024->1536 KB) stays under the 1638 KB LX budget, and
    # two configs with IDENTICAL 1024 KB working sets run at 57.6 vs 80.1 us/GMAC.

    used to key on ``rpc`` alone, and over-predicted a wide tiled softmax by 26-54 % while
    under-predicting a narrow one. What the tile really has to be is BIG -- the fitted
    exponents (0.50, 0.38) put the governing quantity close to ``rpc*cols``, the elements
    each core streams per tile -- so ``r_full`` is now the full-fill height AT ``col_ref``,
    and a tensor half as wide needs ~1.7x the height. See CostParams for the fit.

    SOFTMAX / fused-pointwise ONLY. A coarse-tiled MATMUL goes through
    ``coarse_underfill_eff_matmul``, which is the pre-re-fit rows-only curve held frozen:
    every row behind this surface is a softmax row, and the one check available says the
    new shape does not transfer to matmul. Same split as the sibling
    ``_lx_spill_bw_derate``, which already carries a separate cap/exponent pair for matmul.

def _loop_reread_bytes(ops: list) -> float:
    """HBM bytes re-read because an operand is LOOP-INVARIANT under coarse tiling.

    A coarse-tiled kernel is one op containing an L-iteration loop. An operand whose
    index expression does not involve the tiled loop symbol is re-entered at the SAME
    address every iteration -- so it is transferred L times, not once. The extractor
    marks this per arg as ``loop_factor > 1``; this returns only the EXCESS over the
    first pass, i.e. ``elems * (loop_factor - 1) * dtype``.

    Established for ``matmul_row_tiling`` (tiles M) two independent ways:

    * IR: ``inner_fn`` loads A at ``r0_0 + 2048*i0`` (contains the tiled symbol ``i0``)
      and B at ``i1 + 2048*r0_0`` (does not), with ``loop_tiled_dims=[[0]]`` and
      ``DimHint(dim_names=['M'], loop_var=d0)``.
    * The recorded features already show the asymmetry: ``matmul_b_bytes`` is the FULL
      ``K*N*2`` at every L (ratio 1.00), while ``matmul_a_bytes`` is exactly ``M*K*2/L``.

    B is NOT served from LX. The scratchpad allocator only pins a graph input by cloning
    it, and ``_input_residency_reason``'s first gate rejects any input whose
    ``_read_count`` (which excludes the unavoidable first read) is 0. The L iterations
    live INSIDE one op, so the allocator sees a single use and declines -- confirmed on
    every record we hold: coarse-matmul input args are 0 LX (several hundred
    reads, all HBM; the exact count moves as the database grows), while
    ``softmax_row_tiling`` gets 1420 LX args, so the planner is working and simply does
    not apply here.

    SCOPE -- deliberately narrow. Counts only an **input** of a **matmul** whose loop
    tiles an **output** dim. That is exactly the case established above, and the gate
    matters: ``loop_factor > 1`` ALREADY occurs today on the REDUCTION-tiled ops
    (``matmul_k_tiling``, ``bmm_k_tiling``, ``bmm_3d2d_k_tiling``, ``ctsum``/``ctamax``/
    ``ctamin``), where it is set on the output accumulator AND the inputs alike. Those
    factors mean something different -- under K-tiling each iteration consumes a fresh
    K-slice, so the inputs ADVANCE and only the accumulator is re-touched -- and they are
    part of the known per-iteration-vs-per-loop inconsistency in the extractor, not a
    verified quantity. Charging them here made ``matmul_k`` 7.9 -> 32.4 % and
    ``bmm_3d2d`` 18.0 -> 38.8 %, so they are excluded until that inconsistency is fixed.

    0.0 for every op the extractor emits today (output-dim-tiled matmuls carry
    ``loop_factor = 1`` on all args), so this term is INERT until the extractor sets the
    invariant input's factor -- verified by the gold gate.

    a fused kernel loads each distinct EXTERNAL input from HBM ONCE (re-reads served
    on-chip), so a shared input is not double-counted; reads and writes are summed over
    the bundle before the turnaround term (shared bus). ``eff_underfill`` derates the
    bandwidth term when OUTPUT-dim (coarse) tiling shrinks each core's per-tile stream
    (``coarse_underfill_eff``, keyed on per-core rows per tile AND the row width).

    from HBM once for the whole graph; every reader is then served from LX. Within a
    bundle ``_clone_in_bytes`` already de-duplicates, so keeping the clone-in charge in
    the first reading bundle and clearing it in the rest prices exactly that one load, for
    any number of readers.

    What is cleared is ``owns_boundary_charge``, NOT ``is_boundary``. The latter is also
    the key ``_fused_hbm_bytes`` de-duplicates external reads on, so un-stamping it would
    charge a later multi-op bundle once PER READER -- the double-count that de-duplication
    exists to prevent, and this is the shape it fires on (softmax reads its input in both
    ``amax`` and ``sub``). Leaving the stamp intact also makes the rewrite idempotent and
    independent of which bundle is first.

    Every bundle's read, the first included, is priced like any other arg: freed by
    residency, because the clone is what served it, and charged in full without
    residency, because every bundle re-reads an HBM input. Which bundle is first does not
    depend on residency, so the rewrite is static and the objective stays linear in the
    solver's ``sym_is_lx``.
