"""Mirrors upstream's ``dynamo_timed`` phases into the timing record.

The pass pipelines and the per-kernel backend calls are timed, but they do not
add up to a compile: the enclosing ``stage:compile_fx:spyre_compile`` region was
carrying most of its time as self time, which is to say unattributed.  That
remainder is lowering, codegen, scheduler construction and AOTAutograd tracing --
none of which torch-spyre owns, so none of which a torch-spyre ``stage()`` call
can reach.  Mirroring them takes a one-layer MLP at S=128 from 72% of the compile
unattributed to 1.5%, and names what was hiding there: joint-graph passes at 5.0%
of the compile, AOT metadata collection at 3.2%, Dynamo bytecode tracing at 2.2%,
lowering at 1.2%.

The cost is paid on every ``dynamo_timed`` region whether timing is on or not:
~3.2 us per region off and ~6.4 us on, against upstream's own ~8.0 us for the
region itself.  That MLP mirrors 52 regions, so ~0.17 ms off and ~0.33 ms on
against a 3.4 s compile.  Installed unconditionally rather than only when timing
is on at import, so that enabling it at runtime works.

Upstream already times them.  Every ``dynamo_timed`` region, and a few regions
entered through ``chromium_event_timed`` directly, funnel through two methods on
``ChromiumEventLogger``, unconditionally and regardless of whether the caller
asked for a pt2 compile event.  Wrapping that pair mirrors ~110 upstream phases
into the record for the cost of two monkeypatches, instead of patching
``GraphLowering.run``, ``GraphLowering.codegen``, ``Scheduler.__init__`` and the
AOT entry point one at a time and then chasing whatever upstream adds next.

Nesting comes out right without being arranged.  Upstream's outermost phase,
``entire_frame_compile``, encloses the backend call, so
``stage:compile_fx:spyre_compile`` lands beneath it and Dynamo's own tracing is
that parent's self time -- the same subtraction the record already uses for the
frontend total.  A representative tree::

    stage:torch:entire_frame_compile        Dynamo, whole frame
      stage:torch:compile_attempt_0
        stage:torch:backend_compile         the call into Inductor
          stage:compile_fx:spyre_compile    ours; still the compile grouping key
            stage:torch:create_aot_dispatcher_function
              stage:torch:aot_trace_joint_graph
              stage:torch:GraphLowering.run           lowering
              stage:torch:GraphLowering.codegen
                stage:GraphLowering:update_scheduler  ours
                  stage:torch:Scheduler.__init__
                stage:torch:Scheduler.codegen
                  pipeline:CustomPreFusionPasses      ours
                  stage:SpyreAsyncCompile:backend_compile   per kernel
      stage:torch:build_guards

Three things to know before changing this:

* **Phase names are upstream's, recorded verbatim.**  No mapping table to keep in
  step, and a name is greppable in the torch tree.  The cost is that a torch bump
  can rename one and silently empty a column in a committed baseline, so the
  names this issue asks for by name are constants below and a test asserts each
  one appears in a real compile.  Note ``phase_name=`` overrides the key, which
  is why Dynamo's whole-frame region is ``entire_frame_compile`` and not
  ``_compile.compile_inner``.

* **Upstream has a phase called ``backend_compile`` and so do we**, meaning
  something entirely different: upstream's is the call into Inductor, ours is one
  invocation of the Spyre kernel compiler.  The full names differ by owner
  segment, but a reader matching on the trailing segment alone would total the
  whole Inductor compile as backend time and report a frontend near zero.  Match
  ``timing_recorder.BACKEND_COMPILE_EVENT`` exactly.

* **A phase name can repeat, and the repeats nest.**  ``GraphLowering.run``
  recurses into while-loop bodies and subgraphs: the control-flow workload
  records three, one real lowering span with two inside it.  Totalling
  ``inclusive_ns`` by name overstates that span by 74%.  Sum ``self_ns``, or take
  the outermost.  Upstream's ``compile_id`` is in each event's meta, but it does
  not separate these -- all three share one; the nesting is what separates them.

* **Every compile in the process is recorded, not just Spyre ones.**  Dynamo
  traces before anything knows which device the graph is for, so a filter that
  could tell would also have to run too late to cover Dynamo.  A non-Spyre
  compile shows up as a phase tree with no ``stage:compile_fx:spyre_compile``
  under it, which is what a reader groups by anyway.
