"""Deterministic counts of the frontend's analysis calls.

Timing says a pass is slow. A counter says *why*: how many times it asked the
same question. The two answer different things and fail differently -- a
stopwatch is noisy and unassertable, while a count is reproducible to a fraction
of a percent and can carry a test bound.
The #4113 fix was confirmed by a call count, not by a stopwatch, and the
complexity audit (#4220) needs one falsifying counter per claim.

Counters are read two ways:

* From a timing record. ``passes.py`` snapshots before each pass and writes the
  non-zero deltas into that pass's event ``meta``, so a sweep gets counts and
  time side by side. Pipeline events carry the inclusive total, the same way
  ``inclusive_ns`` does.
* From a test. ``with counted_region() as counts: ...`` installs the wrappers
  regardless of the timing config and hands back what the region counted, so a
  regression guard can assert a bound without turning on recording.

Two mechanisms, split by who owns the code. For Spyre helpers the count lives
in the function body (every consumer imports them by name, so wrapping the
module attribute would miss them). For upstream's
``ComputedBuffer.get_read_writes`` -- which we cannot edit, and which 100-odd
sites call directly, bypassing our memo -- :func:`counting` installs a wrapper
and restores it on exit.

Counts are per-process and unsynchronized: the passes this is aimed at run on
the compiling thread, but a concurrently compiling worker would land in the
same totals. One consequence to know: if the region that installed the counters
exits while another thread's pipeline is still running, the reset leaves that
pipeline's :meth:`PassCounters.since` deltas negative. A reader should treat a
negative delta as "another compile owned the region", not as a measurement.

New counter names need no ``RECORDER_VERSION`` bump; they are event ``meta``,
which readers already treat as open.
