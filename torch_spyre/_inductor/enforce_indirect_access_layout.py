"""Enforce non-stick dimension ordering required by indirect-access ops.

The three-pass restickify pipeline (propagate_layouts -> optimize_restickify ->
insert_restickify) resolves stick-dimension layout constraints. Indirect-access
ops (gather/scatter) impose an additional requirement on non-stick dimension
ordering: the indexed dimension must be outermost in the value tensor's device
layout, based on their coordinate access patterns.

This pass runs after insert_restickify, once every op has a committed
FixedTiledLayout. For indirect-access ops, it checks whether the value tensor's
current dim_order matches this requirement; if not, either rewrites the
producer's output layout in place (if the producer is a ComputedBuffer and not a
graph output) or inserts a spyre.restickify copy in the required layout.
