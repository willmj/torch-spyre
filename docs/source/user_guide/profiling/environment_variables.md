# Environment Variables for Profiling

**Stack:** torch-spyre (new, Inductor-based).

Variables that affect profile capture, telemetry, and observability.
Debug-oriented variables (`TORCH_SPYRE_DEBUG`, `TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG`,
`TORCHINDUCTOR_FORCE_DISABLE_CACHES`, `INDUCTOR_PROVENANCE`,
`TORCH_TRACE`) live under [Debugging](../debugging/index.md); the FFDC
table below re-lists `TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG` only to note its effect on
captured artifacts.

## Logging

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SPYRE_INDUCTOR_LOG=1` | *Deprecated*. Use `TORCH_LOGS="torch_spyre.inductor"`. Enables Spyre-specific Inductor logging (INFO level) |
| `SPYRE_INDUCTOR_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` | *Deprecated*. Use `TORCH_LOGS="+torch_spyre.inductor"`. Sets Spyre Inductor log verbosity to DEBUG |
| `SPYRE_LOG_FILE=path/to/file.log` | *Deprecated*. Mapped to the top-level `spyre` logger file handler. Redirects Spyre Inductor log output to a file |
| `TORCH_LOGS="+torch_spyre.inductor"` | Preferred logging control (DEBUG level). Accepts `torch_spyre.*` namespaces |
| `TORCH_LOGS="torch_spyre.inductor"` | Same as above but at INFO level (no `+` prefix) |
| `TORCH_LOGS="-torch_spyre.inductor"` | Sets to ERROR level (suppresses INFO/DEBUG) |
| `TORCH_LOGS="+inductor"` | Verbose PyTorch Inductor logging |
| `TORCH_SPYRE_DOWNCAST_WARN=0` | Suppress `int64 → int32` downcast warnings |

### Programmatic Configuration

For log levels not supported by `TORCH_LOGS` (WARNING, CRITICAL, DISABLED), use the
programmatic API:

```python
from torch_spyre import logging_config

# Set any log level programmatically
logging_config.set_log_level('spyre.inductor', 'CRITICAL')
logging_config.set_log_level('spyre.runtime', 'WARNING')
logging_config.disable('spyre.execution')  # DISABLED level

# Convenience functions
logging_config.enable('spyre.inductor')   # INFO level
```

**Per-pass DEBUG logging** requires setting both the log level and pass filter:

```python
from torch_spyre import logging_config

# Enable DEBUG level for passes
logging_config.set_log_level('spyre.inductor.passes', 'DEBUG')

# Configure which passes to log
logging_config.set_log_passes('all')                              # All passes
logging_config.set_log_passes('split_multi_ops,insert_restickify') # Specific passes
logging_config.set_log_passes('')                                  # Disable

# Query current configuration
level = logging_config.get_log_level('spyre.inductor.passes')
log_passes = logging_config.get_log_passes()
```

Available levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`, `DISABLED`

**Note:** Use internal `spyre.*` namespace in programmatic calls, not `torch_spyre.*`.
The `torch_spyre.*` namespace is only for the `TORCH_LOGS` environment variable.

## Compiler configuration

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SENCORES=<1..32>` | Number of Spyre cores to target (default 32) |

## Compile-time timing

Measures how long the compiler frontend takes, per pass pipeline and per
pass, with the graph size each pass saw. This is compile time, not runtime:
nothing here reports how long a kernel takes on device.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `TORCH_SPYRE_TIMING=1` | Record structured frontend compile timings (default off) |
| `TORCH_SPYRE_TIMING_OUT=path/rec.json` | Write the record to `path/rec.<pid>.json` at process exit. Empty keeps events in memory only |

```bash
TORCH_SPYRE_TIMING=1 TORCH_SPYRE_TIMING_OUT=/tmp/rec.json python3 my_model.py
# -> /tmp/rec.<pid>.json
```

Each event carries `inclusive_ns` and `self_ns` (inclusive minus direct
children), so a pipeline total and its per-pass breakdown can be read from
one record. Event names have three shapes:

| Name | Region |
|---|---|
| `pipeline:<PipelineClass>` | One pass pipeline, start to finish |
| `pass:<PipelineClass>:<pass_name>` | One pass within it |
| `stage:<Owner>:<what>` | Anything else that is timed |

The `stage:` regions are:

| Name | Region |
|---|---|
| `stage:compile_fx:spyre_compile` | One whole Spyre compile; every other region nests inside it |
| `stage:CustomPreSchedulingPasses:pass_loop` | The pre-scheduling pass list |
| `stage:CustomPreSchedulingPasses:cost_model` / `:cost_dump` | Predicted-runtime report and its per-op dump |
| `stage:CustomPreSchedulingPasses:finalize_work_division` | Work-division ownership handoff to the scheduler |
| `stage:CustomPreSchedulingPasses:log_before` / `:log_after` | The IR dumps, only when INFO logging is on |
| `stage:GraphLowering:update_scheduler` | Upstream scheduler construction |
| `stage:SpyreAsyncCompile:generate_bundle` / `:generate_ktir` | Backend-input generation, per kernel |
| `stage:SpyreAsyncCompile:kernel_provenance` | Kernel provenance descriptor, per kernel |
| `stage:SpyreAsyncCompile:backend_compile` | The backend compiler, per kernel (named in `meta.tool`) |
| `stage:SpyreAsyncCompile:prepare_kernel` | Loading the backend's output |
| `stage:SpyreAsyncCompile:backend_skipped` | Marker where the backend was skipped; its duration is not a measurement |

**Frontend time is a subtraction, not a span**, because the backend runs per
kernel from inside codegen:

```
pre_backend = stage:compile_fx:spyre_compile
              - sum(stage:SpyreAsyncCompile:backend_compile under that compile)
```

A process that compiles several graphs has one `spyre_compile` event per
compile, so group by it rather than summing the whole record.

`backend_compile` is recorded only when the backend runs in-process. With more
than one compile thread the work goes to a pool worker, which does not share this
recorder, so no `backend_compile` event is emitted and the subtraction above
would charge the backend to the frontend. Measure with a single compile thread.

### Skipping the backend

The backend compiler -- `dbo-opt`, by either the sdsc or the `TORCH_SPYRE_KTIR=1`
route -- is invoked once per kernel and usually dominates compile
wall time, so paying for it on every frontend measurement is what makes a sweep
expensive. `TORCH_SPYRE_FRONTEND_ONLY=1` runs the frontend in
full -- all pass pipelines, scheduling, codegen, and backend-input generation --
and stops at each per-kernel backend invocation:

```bash
TORCH_SPYRE_FRONTEND_ONLY=1 TORCH_SPYRE_TIMING=1 \
  TORCH_SPYRE_TIMING_OUT=/tmp/rec.json \
  TORCHINDUCTOR_FORCE_DISABLE_CACHES=1 python3 my_model.py
```

The compile produces **no runnable kernel**: calling one raises a `RuntimeError`
naming the variable and the bundle directory. Use it to measure, never to run --
and to measure several graphs in one process, trigger compilation without
executing the result, since the first call is what raises.

**Disable caches when measuring**, with
`TORCHINDUCTOR_FORCE_DISABLE_CACHES=1`. A cache hit skips the frontend
altogether, so `stage:compile_fx:spyre_compile` would time a cache lookup and
the record would still look valid -- which is what the second iteration of a
sweep does by default.

The Spyre kernel cache (`SPYRE_KERNEL_CACHE=1`) is forced off for the whole run,
so the mode needs no flag of its own. A cache hit returns a compiled kernel
without running bundle generation or the backend, leaving nothing to measure
while still handing back a runnable kernel -- and a bundle with no backend output
must never be committed, because a cache entry that already exists causes every
later complete compile for that key to be discarded.

Caches stay usable afterwards. Each kernel's bundle goes to a fresh directory,
and the generated wrapper re-enters the backend step on a cache reload, so a
normal run reusing the same `TORCHINDUCTOR_CACHE_DIR` still compiles and runs.

The record makes the difference explicit. A normal compile carries one
`stage:SpyreAsyncCompile:backend_compile` event per kernel; a frontend-only
compile carries `stage:SpyreAsyncCompile:backend_skipped` instead. Every record
states the mode in its metadata (`frontend_only: true` or `false`) whether or not
a kernel was skipped, and a frontend-only one also lists
`backend_skipped_kernels`, so a truncated compile can never be mistaken for a
fast one.

What it does not measure: the backend itself, kernel execution, and anything a
later pass would have learned from a compiled artifact. Bundle generation is
inside the boundary, not outside it.

Each pipeline and pass event also carries `meta` with the graph size it saw
(`input_nodes` / `output_nodes`, or `input_operations` / `output_operations`
for the pre-scheduling pipeline) and counts of the analysis calls it made.
Timing says a pass is slow; the counts say how many times it asked the same
question, and unlike a duration they are reproducible to a fraction of a percent. A counter that
did not move is omitted rather than recorded as zero.

| Counter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `read_writes.requests` | Calls to the memoized `op_read_writes` helper: how many times the pass asked |
| `read_writes.misses` | Of those, the ones the per-op memo could not serve |
| `read_writes.extractions` | `ComputedBuffer.get_read_writes` invocations -- the sympy dependency extraction that actually costs something, including callers that bypass the memo |
| `read_writes.extract_ns` | Nanoseconds spent inside those extractions, so a count can be sized rather than guessed |
| `device_coordinates` | Device-space coordinate constructions |
| `host_coordinates` | Host-space coordinate constructions |

`read_writes.extractions` and `read_writes.extract_ns` cover
`ComputedBuffer.get_read_writes` only. The
scheduler extracts directly in `SchedulerNode._compute_attrs`, and so do several
`ir.py` classes (`Loops`, `BaseView`, `TemplateBuffer`), so `extractions` is a
lower bound on dependency extraction and `extract_ns` a lower bound on its cost.

Read these against a baseline record of the same workload rather than in the
absolute. Most extractions come from callers that reach past the memo by design,
so misses sitting far below extractions is the normal state and not a finding; a
*change* in that relationship for one workload is. How much the memo absorbs is
requests against misses, not against extractions. Pipeline events carry the
inclusive total, the same way `inclusive_ns` does.

## FFDC (First Failure Data Capture)

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `TORCH_SPYRE_FFDC=1` | Opt in to automatic FFDC JSON reports on Spyre frontend-compile / backend-compile / runtime / unimplemented failures. Retrieve with `torch.spyre.get_diagnostic_report()`. Separate from `USE_SPYRE_PROFILER` (the `setup.py` Kineto build flag); this env var alone gates capture at runtime and is not set by default on pods. |
| `TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG=1` | Optional. Writes `torch_compile_debug/` artifacts that FFDC links into `artifacts.paths` (see [FFDC user guide](ffdc.md)). Not required for capture. |
| `DUMP_SPYRE_CODE=1` | Optional. Emits `sdsc_*.json` and `*.mlir` bundle files that FFDC can reference. Not required for capture. |

See the [FFDC user guide](ffdc.md) for the full workflow, report locations,
and pod/CI usage.

## Device enumeration

Honored by the `flex` library itself (not read directly by torch-spyre)
when [`spyre_device_enum.cpp`](https://github.com/torch-spyre/torch-spyre/blob/main/torch_spyre/csrc/spyre_device_enum.cpp)
calls `flex::getNumDevices()` to determine how many Spyre devices are
visible to the process:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `FLEX_DEVICE` | Device type: `PF`, `VF`, or `MOCK`. Selects how device count is determined |
| `AIU_WORLD_SIZE` | Number of devices to use; caps the total device count (or is returned directly under `FLEX_DEVICE=MOCK`) |
| `SPYRE_DEVICES` | Comma-separated list of device indices to use (e.g., `0,2,3`); overrides the default enumeration |

Read directly by torch-spyre
([`spyre_guard.cpp`](https://github.com/torch-spyre/torch-spyre/blob/main/torch_spyre/csrc/spyre_guard.cpp))
to pick the device for the current process:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `LOCAL_RANK` | Per-process rank set by `torchrun`; used to select the device for each child process (defaults to 0 if unset) |

Set by the OpenShift AIU operator (or manually); not read directly by
torch-spyre's device-enumeration code:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PCIDEVICE_IBM_COM_AIU_PF` | Comma-separated list of PCI bus IDs assigned to the container; consumed by [`tests/oot_framework/run_test.sh`](https://github.com/torch-spyre/torch-spyre/blob/main/tests/oot_framework/run_test.sh) |
| `AIU_WORLD_RANK_<N>` | PCI bus ID bound to rank `N`; not consumed in-tree — it is scraped back out of pod logs after the fact by [`.github/scripts/parse_hw_failures.py`](https://github.com/torch-spyre/torch-spyre/blob/main/.github/scripts/parse_hw_failures.py) |

## Runtime / driver (for `aiu-smi` and `aiu-trace-analyzer`)

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SENLIB_DEVEL_CONFIG_FILE=<path>` | Point the Spyre driver (`senlib`) at a config file enabling hardware-counter collection; required for `aiu-smi` |
| `DTCOMPILER_KEEP_EXPORT=true` | Keep compiler export directories around after a run; required for `aiu-smi` to report `rsvmem` and for `aiu-trace-analyzer` post-processing |
| `DEEPRT_EXPORT_DIR=<dir>` | Where the runtime / compiler write export artifacts; set to the same path in the workload and monitoring shells |
| `DTCOMPILER_EXPORT_DIR=<dir>` | Override the compiler export location (defaults to CWD when unset) |
| `DT_DEEPRT_VERBOSE=0` | Quiet runtime logs when capturing traces for `aiu-trace-analyzer` |

## Quick-reference recipes

### `aiu-smi` workload shell

```bash
export DTCOMPILER_KEEP_EXPORT=true
export SENLIB_DEVEL_CONFIG_FILE=$HOME/.local/etc/senlib_config_aiusmi.json
# Optional: co-locate compiler exports and aiu-smi lookups
export DEEPRT_EXPORT_DIR=$PWD
```

### `aiu-smi` monitoring shell (run in parallel)

```bash
export DEEPRT_EXPORT_DIR=$PWD   # matches the workload shell
aiu-smi
```
