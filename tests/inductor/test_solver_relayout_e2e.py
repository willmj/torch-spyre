"""End-to-end: a solver-decided LX relayout materializes and runs correctly.

Pointwise ops share their candidate divisions, so on an unconstrained graph a
slicing MATCH is always available for free and the solver would rationally
never shuffle. To exercise the decision deterministically, the match table is
emptied on every edge (monkeypatch), making a relayout the only route to
residency; the real cost objective then chooses it, because the shuffle
(~1-9 us depending on the chosen geometry) beats spilling the 2.10 MB
intermediate through HBM.

Asserts the whole chain: the solver fires the edge, the commit path rebuilds
the plan (views under the chosen divisions, solved addresses), the existing
``materialize_lx_relayouts`` inserts the shuffle, and the compiled graph
computes the right numbers on device.
