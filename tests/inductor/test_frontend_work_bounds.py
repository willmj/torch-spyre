"""Per-operation analysis work on a real compile, bounded.

A timing threshold cannot guard the frontend: per-pass times spread 3.68% median
and 12.9% at p90 across a 50-point sweep, so a bound tight enough to catch a
regression also flakes. The same sweep's work counters spread 0.00% median and
0.03% at p90 -- stable to within a fraction of a percent -- so a bound on them
holds without pinning the implementation.

Two regressions are worth guarding, and they move different counters:

* **The memo stops absorbing repeats.** ``read_writes.misses`` rises toward the
  number of asks. Caught by the misses bound.
* **A caller bypasses the memo**, calling ``op.get_read_writes()`` instead of
  ``op_read_writes(op)``. Requests fall by that caller's share, misses barely
  move (the memo still fills once from whoever asks first), and
  ``read_writes.extractions`` rises. Only the extractions bound sees this.

An earlier revision bounded ``requests / misses`` instead, which catches neither:
defeating the memo fails the misses bound first, and a single bypass cannot move
a 534x ratio below any useful threshold.

Bounds are calibrated on the two graphs below rather than on the sweep, because
the sweep measures the pre-scheduling pipeline over model shapes while these
tests count a whole ``torch.compile`` of a small graph. Measured per operation
(``_calibrate``, torch 2.13 on a Spyre pod):

=================  ====  ========  ============  ==================  ========
workload            ops    misses   extractions  device coordinates  requests
=================  ====  ========  ============  ==================  ========
matmul_chain          4      1.50        102.00               31.00    203.25
elementwise_chain    32      1.03        107.03               26.81    214.31
=================  ====  ========  ============  ==================  ========

Taken with ``sencores=32``, ``lx_planning=True``, ``hbm_pool_planning=True``
and ``layout_solver="cpsat"``, which ``_counted_compile`` pins so the bounds do
not float on the shell's environment.

The sweep's figures over 4,443 operations counted at pre-scheduling-pipeline
entry -- 1.32 misses, 90.7 extractions, 39.1 device coordinates, 705.9 requests
per operation -- agree on everything except requests, which are far lower here
because a four-operation graph gives later passes little to re-ask about.

``matmul_chain``'s 1.50 misses per operation is a small-N artifact: six misses
over four operations. The bound holds anyway, and the second workload at 32
operations is the one that pins it.
