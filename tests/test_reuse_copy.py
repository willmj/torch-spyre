"""copy_reused_cases: a delta run reports its whole tier, marked with who ran what.

A delta run executes only the set difference of a tier (measured on torch-spyre: a
regression run reusing integration runs 75 of 136 configs, 19 if it also reuses unit).
The rest are copied in from the covering run so `GROUP BY run_id` is correct without a
union view. `props['ran_in']` names the run that ACTUALLY executed each case.

These tests pin the three properties that were verified against the live dev instance
and that a refactor would quietly break:
  * ran_in is PRESERVED on a copy-of-a-copy, which is what makes reuse recursive with no
    chain to walk;
  * a re-copy from the same source adds nothing (the XML path's own dedup keys on
    props['source_file'], which copies inherit, so it cannot see a re-copy -- without the
    guard here a second call doubled 4 rows to 8);
  * a DIFFERENT source run can still contribute.
