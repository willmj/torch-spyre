-- RERUNNABLE
-- Re-key benchmark_id so a compiled kernel keeps one id across compiles: its kernel_name hashes as
-- `<stem>@<rank>` (BenchmarkId.rank_kernels), not with the per-compile `_<16 x [a-z0-9]>` token.
-- The rank is per source file, slowest first, ties by raw name; the raw name moves to the run
-- row's props and the key to benchmarks.props['kernel_key']. Every other hash input is
-- unchanged, so only compiled-kernel rows move.
--
-- The uuid5 below is BenchmarkId.derive in SQL over ingest_xml's _V2_BENCH_ID_KEYS, which must
-- match `keys`. Pinned for review, matching test_identity_golden: component 'torch-spyre', name
-- 'softmax', no tags, kernel_name 'spyre_kernel_v1_fused_softmax#2@1', other keys empty
-- -> d1ebd21d-1a04-5c64-9e52-5dd2c542cb36.
--
-- Safe to repeat: rows the ingest already keyed this way hash to their own id and are skipped;
-- rows written after the snapshot wait for the next pass. Order-independent with
-- 62-benchmark-verdicts.sql: its verdict table is re-keyed when it exists, skipped when not.
