# GitHub Actions: reusable workflows and composite actions

[← Back to index](README.md)

`extensions/clickhouse-ingest` never runs on its own. Three product repos —
**torch-spyre**, **spyre-inference**, and **hf-adapters** — install it in CI
and drive it from GitHub Actions. Rather than each repo carrying its own
checkout+venv+install+parse+ingest sequence, the actual implementation lives
once, as **seven composite actions in `torch-spyre/.github/actions/`**, callable
from any repo as:

```yaml
uses: torch-spyre/torch-spyre/.github/actions/<name>@main
```

Because a composite action cannot receive secrets implicitly, every one of
them takes the ClickHouse connection as **plain inputs**, and every one gates
itself to a clean no-op when `clickhouse-host` is empty — a caller with no
ClickHouse secrets configured (or a fork, or a dev sandbox) simply skips the
ingest rather than failing the run.

## The seven composite actions

### `setup-clickhouse-ingest` — foundation

The one place that locates — or sparse-checks-out — the library plus a
caller's own scripts, and installs them into a job-local venv. Every action
below calls this one first.

Search order: `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, then `torch-spyre-dir`, then a
sparse-checkout of `script-repo` (default `torch-spyre/torch-spyre`) —
never a prebaked image tree, which would silently pin the scripts to
whatever commit built that image.

| Input | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `extra-scripts` | Newline-separated `.github/scripts/*.py` paths the caller needs, beyond the library itself. |
| `extra-deps` | Extra pip packages beyond `clickhouse-connect` + `regex`. |
| `script-repo` / `script-ref` | Sparse-checkout fallback source. Consumers outside torch-spyre must keep the default `script-repo`, or the fallback checks out the calling repo and finds nothing. |
| `torch-spyre-dir` | Fallback directory holding a torch-spyre checkout, searched before a sparse-checkout. |

Output: `root` — the directory holding both trees for this call.

### `ingest-xml-to-clickhouse`

JUnit + benchmark XML to ClickHouse, via `python -m spyre_clickhouse_ingest results`. The only ingest
implementation for the schema-v2 functional/benchmark tables; every repo's
XML pipeline ends here.

| Key input | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `xml-dir` | Directory to glob for `*.xml`, non-recursive. Empty skips the whole action. |
| `run-id` / `gha-run-id` | Threaded orchestrator uuid (joins `artifact_results`) vs. the numeric GHA dedup key. |
| `artifact-id` | From `derive-gha-artifact-id`. Set, it also writes the `artifacts` row + verdict; empty writes neither. |
| `artifact` / `tag-family` / `tag` / `tag-date` | Name the artifact the run tested by any spec (`image:`, `id:`, `gha:`, ...), and how to tag it; the same options as [`v2-artifact`](#v2-artifact). |
| `component` / `platform` / `trigger-type` | Hash inputs and tier label stamped on v2 rows — `component` is the value that keeps hf-adapters' and torch-spyre's `test_cases` from colliding on an identically-named test. |
| `schema` | `v1` (default) / `v2` / `both` — the migration-window switch. |
| `clickhouse-*` | Connection; empty `clickhouse-host` is a clean no-op. |

### `ingest-hw-diagnostics-to-clickhouse`

Downloads every job log from a GHA run, parses it for hardware failures
(`parse_hw_failures.py`), and inserts the records (`ingest_hw_diagnostics.py`)
— the pipeline that backs the "Spyre Hardware Health" Grafana dashboard.
Without it, a card-level RAS fault surfaces only as a pytest failure and never
reaches the hardware-health view.

| Key input | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gha-run-id` (required) | Run whose job logs are analysed. |
| `arch` | Arch of the analysed legs — never `$(uname -m)` of the ingest runner itself. A wrong value derives a `run_id` that joins nothing, silently. |
| `clickhouse-db-v2` / `schema` | `hw_failure_diagnostics` has the same shape in both generations, so v2 reinserts the same rows qualified with this database instead of diverging into a new table model. |

Output: `json-file` — the parsed JSON, for the caller to upload as its own
artifact.

Currently called by torch-spyre and spyre-inference only — see
[What does not exist yet](#what-does-not-exist-yet).

### `ingest-model-ops-to-clickhouse`

Downloads model-ops job logs, parses them for operation-support variants
(`parse_model_ops_logs.py`), and inserts them (`ingest_model_ops.py`) into the
v1 `model_ops_*` tables only. Filters strictly on the job-name prefix
`model-ops /`, not a `Spyre` substring match — a regression-matrix job also
carries that word and would otherwise land as a fake model-ops suite. The v2
`capabilities`/`capability_runs` verdicts come from the suites' JUnit
`capability.*` properties instead, through `ingest-xml-to-clickhouse`.

| Key input | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gha-run-id` (required) | Nightly run to analyse. |

Outputs: `json-file`, `log-file`, `has-variant-data` — the ingest step is
skipped whenever parsing found zero variants, so an in-progress or
log-unavailable run never overwrites good stored suites with empty ones.

### `ingest-pytorch-dispatch-to-clickhouse`

Classifies a `repository_dispatch` payload from pytorch/pytorch's CI relay
(CRCR) and records it via `ingest_pytorch_dispatch.py` — one implementation,
so another repo tracking the same relay calls it directly rather than
reimplementing the classification.

| Key input | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `payload-json` (required) | The dispatch's `client_payload`, as JSON text. |
| `stage` / `progress` | Pipeline point (`torch_build`, `running_tests`, ...) and lifecycle state (`in_progress` / `completed` / `rejected`). |

### `v2-artifact`

Names an artifact by spec and returns its one `spyre_v2` `artifact_id`
(`python -m spyre_clickhouse_ingest artifacts ensure`): the existing record when
there is one, else the derived identity, recorded and tagged.

```yaml
- id: art
  uses: torch-spyre/torch-spyre/.github/actions/v2-artifact@main
  with:
    artifact: image:icr.io/<repo>@sha256:<list digest>
    arch: s390x
    tag-family: nightly-supply-chain
    clickhouse-host: ${{ secrets.CLICKHOUSE_HOST }}
    # clickhouse-port / -user / -pass / -db-v2, registry-* for image specs
- run: echo "${{ steps.art.outputs.artifact-id }}"
```

| Key input | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `artifact`, `arch` | The spec and its arch (`multi` keeps a manifest list). |
| `tag-family`, `tag`, `tag-date` | How it is tagged; see the top-level README's tag families. |
| `lookup`, `registry` | `auto` / `off` / `only` (must already be recorded); `auto` / `off`. |
| `origin`, `source`, `identity-dep`, `context-dep`, `prop`, `tag-prop`, `run-url` | Recorded fields of a new record (multi-valued inputs one per line). |
| `dry-run`, `strict` | Print what would be written; fail the job on an error (by default an error annotation and empty outputs). |

Outputs: `artifact-id`, `tag`, `tag-family`, `source` (`given`, `existing`,
`label` or `derived`) and `json` (the full `artifacts ensure` result).

### `derive-gha-artifact-id`

Derives the warehouse `artifact_id` for what a GHA leg actually ran, and
uploads it so a later `workflow_run` ingest can stamp it on the rows. Must run
on the image under test — the base id lives in that image's own filesystem.
Empty output is a normal outcome, never a failure: an image baked before the
base-id label existed carries none.

| Key input | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `installed` | What this leg installed on top of the image, space/comma-separated. Empty = image ran unchanged, base id used verbatim. |
| `output-file` | Uploaded as a one-line record, not a bare uuid (uuid5 can't be read back): `<artifact_id>|<base_artifact_id>|<installed,comma,joined>`. |

Outputs: `artifact_id`, `base_artifact_id`.

hf-adapters' weekly scan doesn't call the `ingest-model-ops-to-clickhouse`
action (it isn't log-driven), but it dual-writes through the exact same
`CapabilityWriter` classes the action's script uses underneath — see
[capability_write.py in the class reference](classes.md#writerpy).

## torch-spyre's own workflows

| Workflow | Triggers | Calls |
|---|---|---|
| `push-to-clickhouse.yaml` | `workflow_run` of `model-module-tests`, `upstream-pytorch-tests`, `tests`, `integration-tests`; manual dispatch | `ingest-xml-to-clickhouse` (v1 direct write + v2 via the action, once per populated arch: x86_64/ppc64le/s390x) |
| `push-hw-diagnostics-to-clickhouse.yaml` | same `workflow_run` set | `ingest-hw-diagnostics-to-clickhouse` |
| `push-model-ops-logs-to-clickhouse.yaml` | model-ops nightly run completion | `ingest-model-ops-to-clickhouse` (v1 only) |
| `push-pytorch-dispatch-to-clickhouse.yaml` | `repository_dispatch` from pytorch/pytorch's CRCR relay | `ingest-pytorch-dispatch-to-clickhouse` |

`derive-gha-artifact-id` runs earlier, inside the test-execution workflow
itself (on the image under test), not inside any `push-*` workflow — its
output is what a later `push-to-clickhouse.yaml` run picks up as
`--artifact-id`.

---

## spyre-inference's own workflows

### `push-to-clickhouse.yaml`

Ingests JUnit XML from spyre-inference's own pytest matrix. Triggered by
`workflow_run` of `integration-tests` or `test_each_commit` (both call the
same reusable `_test_matrix.yaml`, so they emit the same suite shape), plus
manual dispatch to re-ingest a specific run.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["workflow_run: integration-tests / test_each_commit"] --> B["download every artifact from the triggering run"]
  B --> C["ingest_xml_si.py writes si_test_runs / si_test_cases v1"]
  C --> D["group XML by leg arch x86_64 / ppc64le / s390x"]
  D --> E1["ingest-xml-to-clickhouse component spyre-inference x86_64"]
  D --> E2["ingest-xml-to-clickhouse ppc64le"]
  D --> E3["ingest-xml-to-clickhouse s390x"]
  E1 --> F[("test_cases / test_case_runs / benchmarks / benchmark_runs")]
  E2 --> F
  E3 --> F
```

Notable: XML artifacts are downloaded paginated (`gh api --paginate`) — the
artifacts endpoint defaults to 30/page, and an unpaginated call against a run
with more jobs than that silently lost XML with no error.

### `push-hw-diagnostics-to-clickhouse.yaml`

A single-step job: calls `ingest-hw-diagnostics-to-clickhouse` with
`schema: both` (dual-write during the v1-to-v2 migration window) and a
hardcoded `arch: x86_64` — literal, not `$(uname -m)`, because the HW test
matrix this workflow follows only runs on the x86 Spyre pool today.

---

## hf-adapters' own workflows

hf-adapters has two clickhouse-facing workflows with a naming trap worth
calling out explicitly: `push-to-clickhouse.yaml` here is not the XML ingest
— that name was already taken by an unrelated weekly cron job before the XML
ingest existed, so the XML ingest lives in `push-test-results-to-clickhouse.yaml`
instead.

### `push-test-results-to-clickhouse.yaml`

Two independent jobs, both triggered by `workflow_run` of `integration-tests`
or `test_pull_request`:

`ingest` — JUnit XML from hf-adapters' model-centric e2e suites (smoke, load,
token_compare, embed_compare, vlm, model_module):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["workflow_run"] --> B["download + unzip every artifact"]
  B --> C["ingest_xml_hf_adapters.py writes hf_test_runs / hf_test_cases v1"]
  C --> D["flatten XML into one dir, the shared action globs non-recursively"]
  D --> E["ingest-xml-to-clickhouse component hf-adapters schema v2"]
  E --> F[("test_cases / test_case_runs")]
```

`ingest-module-logs` — raw GHA job logs from the `Spyre model-module tests`
job family, writing `module_test_suites` / `module_test_variants`. This path
is independent of `spyre_clickhouse_ingest` entirely: `ingest_module_tests.py`
declares its own inline DDL and derives row identity from
`SHA256(gha_run_id || suite_name)`, not `identity.py`'s `uuid5` scheme. Treat
it as a related but separately-maintained v1 write path, not a consumer of
this library's identity functions.

### `push-to-clickhouse.yaml` — the weekly HF-Hub model-support scan

Not a post-hoc XML ingest at all: this workflow *is* the test — it fetches
the top-K HuggingFace Hub models, evaluates each on CPU/GPU/Spyre, and writes
its own verdict directly.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["generate-matrix: fetch + filter + shard top-K models"] --> B["weekly-model-scan x1 x2 x4, parallel, sharded by param count"]
  B --> C["ClickHouseResultSink v1: embedding_model_spyre_support / generative_model_spyre_support"]
  B --> D["capability_write.py v2 dual-write: CapabilityWriter, test_type=model_support"]
  D --> E[("capabilities / capability_runs")]
```

The v2 half (`capability_write.py`) is a direct consumer of this library's
`CapabilityWriter` — see [its writer.py entry](classes.md#writerpy) for the
identity/sharding details. It installs the library as a per-job step
(`CH_INGEST_LIB`), never as a `pyproject.toml` dependency, for the same
reason spyre-inference does: `build-hf-adapters` runs `uv sync --frozen`,
which would otherwise pin the library to a locked commit.

---

## What does not exist yet

Documenting this repo's own request accurately means saying plainly where the
pattern is not implemented, rather than describing a symmetry that doesn't
exist on disk:

- hf-adapters has no hardware-diagnostics ingest. There is no
  `push-hw-diagnostics-to-clickhouse.yaml`, no call to
  `ingest-hw-diagnostics-to-clickhouse`, and no `hw_failure_diagnostics` write
  path anywhere in the repo as of this writing. Only torch-spyre and
  spyre-inference currently populate that table. Adding it to hf-adapters
  would mean a new workflow calling `ingest-hw-diagnostics-to-clickhouse`
  with `component: hf-adapters`, following the exact shape of
  spyre-inference's `push-hw-diagnostics-to-clickhouse.yaml` above.
- `ingest_module_tests.py` (hf-adapters) is not a `spyre_clickhouse_ingest`
  consumer, despite living beside one — see the module-logs job above.
